However this doesn't seem to be the case here... if I write it like that Haskell throws an error saying, that \n  Couldn't match type ‘Char’ with ‘[Char]’ Expected type: [[String]] Actual type: [String] \n And I can't figure out why... Is there anything Im missing? Is there a general way of getting all last elements out of the Strings in a String List?\n For testing purposes Ive also tried using map \n map (read . last) testInputf \n which throws the same error and I can't figure out why...\n Thank you very much!\n    submitted by    /u/mathiscool42  \n [link]   [comments]",

A couple of months ago I posted an advertisement for a user study for Chameleon. After that post, I was overwhelmed by a very generous amount of participation and constructive feedback from the wholesome r/haskell community. This time I want to conduct the study with more complicated code challenges. Some of the code I took from real-life Haskell projects, such as Cabal, hledger, xmonad,etc.\n If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming research, or you want to check out our Haskell type debugging tool, please click this link to proceed https://sup.ercu.be. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 20 - 30 minutes to complete. But in turn, it will help us immensely.\n I am happy to answer any questions regarding Chameleon in this thread.\n Thank you,\n Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team\n    submitted by    /u/tonynotworking  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If I were a teacher of high-schoolers wanting to connect some underlying theory to Haskell, could I explain Haskell list comprehensions as basically just a Cartesian/cross product machine? Would this be accurate? And then the combinatorics product rule also seems at play here. I would appreciate any theoretical explanation of what a list comprehension is about.\n Edit: Looking at the Report I can see and understand the details, but somehow that list of facts in the \"Translations\" box implies, results in the Cartesian product. I'd like to know how and why.\n Edit 2.0: I guess I'm just trying to fathom what exactly a list comprehension is. The obvious answer is it's supposed to be some sort of set comprehension. But if a standard use of it is like this\n [(x,y) | x<-xs, y<-ys] \n producing the Cartesian product, then it's obvious the Cartesian product is built into this thing, i.e., that Haskell Report description is creating a Cartesian product machine with the ability to ad lib seeming non-binary relation Cartesian things when we want. So even if I do this\n [x+x | x<-[2]] [4] \n I'm still using (or bypassing most of) that same inherent Cartesian product mechanism. This gets silly\n [x+y | x<-[1..10], y<-[1..10], x == y, x == 2] [4] \n but yes, this is a Cartesian \"all possible combinations\" product, which is then filtered. If I'm right, this is marvelous, i.e., a \"generalized\" Cartesian product algorithm-thingy.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

After some hesitations I finally decided to deep dive into Haskell and understand how to create a Plutus Smart Contract. But, you know, it’s a winding road.\n I’m currently working on the white paper of a new DAO that is basically a VC fund on blockchain. Till now, the logic I put in place (not technical, just conceptual) is blockchain agnostic. In other words, I delayed as much as possible the implementation to focus on the DAO mechanics.\n Now, the time has arrived and I have to chose between Ethereum and Cardano.\n Since I was an Ethereum dev it’d be easier to develop it in solidity, but gas cost and the huge number of active DAOs today is scaring me. Cardano is great but I just started studying it, so I really don’t know if it can be suitable for a complex DAO.\n Do you have any suggestion?

          "description": "I'm new to learning about Cardano. I've got a question about the interaction between native tokens and smart contracts - how can conditions be imposed on the transfer of tokens on Cardano?\n On Ethereum for example we know any token that isn't ether is a second class citizen and requires interaction with a smart contract to do anything. We know this has all sorts of disadvantages and introduces an overhead in terms of computation required on the EVM.\n But one advantage is that whilst settlement itself is computationally more intensive than needed, it would be very natural to impose conditions on the terms of settlement since that just requires augmenting the smart contract that already necessarily exists.\n How can conditions be imposed on Cardano when tokens are native citizens? Is there an elegant way to force the owner of a token to interact with a smart contract (and the computation layer) before settlement? \n Conceptually speaking, I would imagine the way to do this is to impose datums on every UTXO, then having that self-propagate onto the next UTXO when the transaction is built. But can this be codified at the time of minting? Because my understanding of the resources I've read so far only mentions minting policy, which seems to only concern things like minting and burning.\n Let's say I'm issuing tokens that contain the hashes for something that should be non-transferrable - a university degree, or some form of identification. On Ethereum I could simply write into the smart contract conditions to prevent me from sending the ERC-721 token out of my account. How can this be done on Cardano, and when and where would I need to enumerate these conditions?\n    submitted by    /u/MoleculesOfFreedom  \n [link]   [comments]",

A more complicated transaction would need to happen with metadata...but seems short sighted to not build the tutorial for this portion?\n ...I mean theoretically you could always add the UTXO you received initially to a list to avoid, but that only restricts you in one manner...*meh*\n    submitted by    /u/shawnsblog  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have recently began reading on the workings of cardano, its academic background and foundation and believe it has potential to be a great blockchain if not the best if more developers hop on board.\n So as a result I'm interested in learning how to develop cardano dapps, I know that Haskell is a non conditional prerequisite that one must learn to enter this space. What I would like to know is how much Lambda Calculus is truly need for me to know in order to create full functioning quality Dapps with Haskel. I will admit im not the strongest in math but I am capable of learning lambda if need be, I just need to know if it's something I MUST know in order to be a functional cardano dev.\n ​\n thanks in advance for any responses.\n    submitted by    /u/TheOddYehudi919  \n [link]   [comments]",

Each of these actions affects the liquidity reserves in the DEX and each swap may affect the prices for subsequent actions.\n We have developed a general-purpose algorithm (we call it “streaming merge”) that will allow our users to interact with our protocol concurrently without interruption or interference from anyone…",

Lately, I've been very interested in developing my skills within the cryptocurrency industry and have been pondering if working within the spear is a viable option for me.\n To provide some background, I am a college graduate living in the US with a computer science degree and I'm very interested in the ideals of cryptocurrency and the technology behind it. I'd love to learn how to program on the blockchain, specifically on Cardano. At the present moment, I have the opportunity to work on an up-and-coming metaverse project but I'm wary regarding the legality of making money through such means. The only reason that I'm cautious is the precarious situation crypto finds itself in the US. If I make ADA through this project, am I infringing on any laws that prohibit me from making a living by receiving ADA as payment?\n I'm well aware Reddit is probably not the best place to be asking for legal advice, but I'd figure I'd see if anyone had any insight that could help me.

          "description": "Hello,\n Just a reminder that there is a reason why pool can become saturated - the idea behind it is to tackle centralization which is caused by too many people delegating to one large pool that would be in control of majority of network and could start doing all sorts of nasty things.\n It doesn't really work, because many large pool operators ignore the saturation limits and simply create a farm of multiple pools. But just because this is technically possible, doesn't mean it's right, they are still a single centralized entity, just spread into more pools.\n Centralization harms the value of whole chain and also some of the largest farms have so extreme ADA income that they simply sell most of it on CEXes pushing the value even lower, unlike small pools that usually readd their rewards into pledge in order to remain competitive.\n If you already stake with a pool farm, please consider switching to a single pool. There are many of them that have lowest possible margin and ROI even better than some of the huge pool farms (just check on adapools if the pool is member of \"single pool operators\", if not, they are a pool farm). Best pools would be those in \"single pool alliance\" - those pools are committed to never run more than 1 pool - https://adapools.org/alli/cardano-single-pool-alliance/6\n Thanks for keeping the network decentralized!\n    submitted by    /u/petr_bena  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have daedalus on my pc. When I first got into ADA and wanted to stake i chose daedalus because I didn't want a light wallet like Yoroi on my phone. It was just a personal preference. Also it is more secure because it is an actual node.\n I've seen posts about people complaining that daedalus takes to long to load for some. Here is why. I watched Charles' recent AMA on YouTube and a question about daedalus being too slow was asked. Charles replied with why. Downloading a whole node is very heavy software. You have to have the appropriate hardware for it to run. When I first downloaded it, it took about 7 hours to sync. That's normal for the first time. Now it's about 10-15 min.\n I didn't know why it took so long until Charles said that but, it makes sense now. Heavy software needs decent hardware. He said that using a BTC node or and ETH node is the same. I say again heavy software needs good hardware. \n Daedalus being released first was the main focus so that the Cardano network could get fully decentralized faster. Then came the light wallets. In the recent AMA he said that daedalus is a big focus for 2022 to make sync times faster. They are working on it. \n Sidebar: anyone else appreciating these discount prices as much as me? \n Some transparency: i am in no way shape or form a whale. I buy when I can afford it. I believe in cardano and it's future in making the world a better place. \n Much love to the ADAGANG.\n    submitted by    /u/yaboiswigz  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could not recovery any of my old wallets.\n I attempted the recovery process again today and I was able to bring back one wallet, but I still can't get my other. I know my recovery phrase is correct because I can pull the wallet up in Adalite. Stranger yet, I know Yoroi is accepting every word except the first.\n I searched Twitter and this subreddit.

          "description": "Hello, I don't want to look like I shill some other coin I hold, but I noticed that NavCoin created a bridge to BSC in the past. I don't perfectly understand how it works under the hood, but it seems that they are using some kind of crypto black magic, where you create a special \"dual wallet\" that uses same cryptography on both chains and using BSC smart contract you can either lock coins on one side and release them on another, or the other way. So either you have NAV on NavCoin chain, or wNAV on BSC chain, both tokens being fully interchangeable.\n On top of that you can even keep wNAV you moved to BSC still staked on native NavCoin chain (just FYI NavCoin is PoS UTXO chain, similarly to Cardano).\n Is it possible to create similar kind of bridge also to Cardano? If yes, how? Do Cardano smart contracts support such a thing? I think that both chains would tremendously benefit from such bridge. NavCoin doesn't have smart contracts at all, but on other hand it has privacy coin (xNAV), which Cardano is lacking and to be honest I don't think Cardano is ever going to support any privacy coin. So this way we could get best of the two worlds. Is this theoretically possible?\n    submitted by    /u/petr_bena  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been reading and seeking enlightenment. Most of the whitepapers for Maladex, Liqwid, SundaeSwap, etc. don't quite tell me what I (and, judging from postings I see here, what others), need to know.\n I'm finally getting somewhere, though, and wanted to re-link to this video, posted to Reddit a week ago by u/lukasbradley, here, and add, for those like me who don't \"get\" Cardano DEXes, that the speaker being interviewed in that video provides a really lucid explanation of how things work - how the eUTxO model allows users to specify the conditions under which a particular contract executes, and puts those conditions right into the eUTxO, which is signed by the user. He talks, in an informal way that I personally \"get,\" about how the account, UTxO, and eUTxO models differ and what this means for software engineers like him.\n The key is that the eUTxO model allows for a finely-tuned, predictable, conditional execution by the DEX. You're giving up a very precise amount of control to the DEX, and making it conditional.\n Quiz: When done, you should be able to explain how the owner, witness, datum, and redeemer all function in a Cardano eUTxO.\n I know everything said in that video has been said before, but that video somehow put things all together for me. Please, anyone still confused about the difference between building a DEX for an account, and an (e)UTxO, model, watch this. It'll help.\n    submitted by    /u/rlgoer  \n [link]   [comments]",

But they are seemingly late, and they're trying to change the narrative from one in which the metaverse is something detached from reality to one in which the metaverse interacts with the real world (remember that Niantic is first and foremost and augmented reality game designer).\n I wonder whether Niantic might, as they scramble to catch up (or change narratives), might be open to joining forces with an open, public blockchain, and building an infrastructure.\n Pokémon Go has always been about artifacts of varying rarity that people show off, trade, and (despite Niantic's best efforts to design around and squelch it) buy and sell in some fashion. Seems a natural fit for NFTs, and I imagine Niantic would be more open to an open marketplace if the contracts attached to their NFTs specified that they get a small cut - which you can do with Cardano. Identity is also a challenge (can I trust this person I am trading or raiding with?), and I imagine self-sovereign identity systems might be useful here.\n All of this is pretty obvious. But Niantic is, as noted, catching up. Maybe they are in a more pliable and open state than usual?\n It would be nice to have a major gaming outfit onboard with Cardano.\n    submitted by    /u/rlgoer  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don’t even know if my computer could load Daedalus at this point so I’m not even gonna try unless I have to. Do I need a seed phrase? Do I input my ledger seed phrase? That just seems dodgy as hell and even if people suggest this I’m not going to do it and I’ll have to find a different solution. If I load Yoroi as a Chrome extension, will it prompt me to connect a hardware wallet which will automatically load my coins?\n Also, I started out simply enough with just buying on an exchange and staking my coins. Now I’m messing around beyond my pay grade; concentrated liquidity positions, bridging assets between chains, connecting my MetaMask to various Dapps and smart contracts, etc. I use my computer for personal use and crypto shit. Is this a horrible idea as long as I’m connected to a hardware wallet? \n Sorry for all the noob questions but I figured I might as well ask here as I need to access Yoroi and the community as a whole has been quite helpful.

But the sundae testnet so far has been very discouraging. I first jumped in on Monday, Dec 6 when it was launched. Nothing worked for me. And there were many UI bugs that should have been fixed prior to a network scalability test (which is what I assume is the main reason to test on public testnet). Today, four days later, I came back to take another shot. Some things have been improved but still seeing many errors and have not seen a successful swap occur. The swap delay is concerning as that enforces the narrative on Cardano not able to handle concurrency. So I asked myself, would I swap or add liquidity on sundae if it was in mainnet today or next week. No. Really looking forward to Hydra, P2P networking and anything else that can improve scalability \n Would you trade on sundae today or next week? What is your experience?

In 10 or 15 years he could use the money for his child. \n But ive red that staking pools vary on payout ratio, depending on how many people use it. \n Actually im fine with the APR going up and down a bit.

          "description": "I've never used a Dex and am relatively new to Defi, but as I lean more about how these Dexs work they don't seem to be decentralized at all. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems you need to use a centralized Web interface, controlled entirely by the team that produced it. They do the swaps off-chain (e.g. using a \"scooper\" on SundaeSwap), and then the final transactions are batched and recorded on the blockchain. So, it seems Cardano is only involved in the settlement process, not in the swap process.\n I envisioned a swap smart contract that accepted buy- and sell-order transactions, matched them up, and did the swap and settlement all autonomously. Users could submit these transactions using their wallet or the Cardano CLI. After the smart contract was published, the team that developed it could dissolve and the smart contract would remain and run indefinitely.\n Is the current centralization and dependency on a 3rd party team like SundaeSwap Labs just temporary while we wait for Hydra or other technologies on the Cardano network to be developed, or am I expecting too much?\n    submitted by    /u/JinShil  \n [link]   [comments]",

Besides SundaeSwap, there's Minswap, Maladex, Cardax, Ardana, Ergodex (but I've seen a few post regariding this dex in the past), Matrixswap, and Mirquir. I dunno If I missed one.

It's extraordinary to me that when people are so close in philosophy and viewpoint, and in some cases technology, they can be so far apart as people. It's extraordinary.\n You don't see this in other industries. You don't see in physics or biology, or cellphone manufacturing, or whatever, pick an industry, the amount of tribalism, hate, and vitriol that our industry has for each other. And as long as we're doing that to each other, there's no reality where we're ever going to be able to overcome the real enemy, which is the legacy systems that hold three billion people and the human race down, destroy our environment, and divide us in ways that make us hate people we've never met and should never have grievances against.\n That has to stop. And the only way it's going to stop is if we get better systems that are more fair. And the only way we do that, is we have to work together. So, we'll see, 2022 whether that's accomplished. People will still try to divide us. Books will be published. Podcasters will say things. Reddit and Twitter will continue to pour rivers of verbal diarrhea. But it's up to each and every one of us to transcend that, step above it, and realize that we have a finite window.\n    submitted by    /u/EpicMichaelFreeman  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are also 100 players. The game is simple: each player writes down which prize they want, without looking at other people's entry. Then, the players simply receive the price they wrote down! However, if multiple people write down the same prize, the price is given randomly to one of the people who wanted it. Which prize would you choose? You might instantly want to pick $10, but if many people think like that, the chances of getting this prize is low, leading to a low expected (or average) …",

We've been trying to extend this help to many DEXes and applications in the ecosystem.\n It's very important to understand that developing on Cardano is a new experience for the vast majority of the community and it will require some time for projects to fully understand, become productive, and deliver their DApps. The point of testnets are to provide early adopters and software developers a chance to iron out many issues that could impact quality, security, or user experience. Thus, by defintion, issues are expected, bugs should be encountered, and delays will happen. It's part of the process and I'm sure tbe team is hard at work chipping away at these things.\n    submitted by    /u/abu_alkindi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using Backblaze for a few years for my home computer. You know how everyone keeps telling you, a backup is only a true backup once you've done at least one restore? Now I know why (silly me).\nI just got a \"Safety Freeze\" error [1] - essentially some inconsistency with my backup. Backblaze will not tell me the actual cause of this inconsistency. It's possible that some data might be missing - Backblaze doesn't tell me though.\nThe only official solution is to manually check all files (millions in my case). I also can't download a full backup since Backblaze only allows downloads of up to 500GB at once. So my only option is to do a full hard drive restore, costing $189 + customs in Europe, so at the end probably closer to 300€. But even then I won't know if/which of my data was corrupted.\nWhat bugs me is that the Backblaze desktop software should be able to resolve this - it should be possible to do a hash of all the files that are in the most recent backup, and cross-check it with the hashes of the files on my machine.\nNot sure what I should do now.\nEdit: This is the response from the Backblaze support:\n> I apologize, but this [=manually checking all files] would in fact be the only sure fire way if you are concerned about any deleted files. There wouldn't be a way to compare hashes the way you describe in this case as that mechanism is simply not implemented into the Backblaze software. The Backblaze software is intended to prevent data loss. It would not be intended to be able to automatically cross reference local and server data against each other to display what is and is not backed up on our servers.\nThey can't be serious with this?\n[1] https://www.backblaze.com/safety_frozen.html\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29533753\nPoints: 148\n# Comments: 130",

          "description": "The HN homepage has five ranks colored black rather than gray. Currently this is \"Learning how to ride a bike\", \"Log4j: Between a rock and a hard place\", \"How to train your decision-making AIs\", \"Carolina Gold was once the most popular rice grown in America (2019)\", and \"Packaging for instant coffee made out of seaweed\". It seems to follow the story, e.g. the bike story was #12 before and now it's #13: the color moved with it. They do not have in common a recent/old submission time, high/low score, or high/low comments.\nThe HTML difference is `$rank` being inserted around the rank.\nIt also shows up in incognito mode with the same ones colored black, so I don't think it's account-related.\n(Some rambling follows, I'm not actually serious about a secret hidden meaning, just a toy idea. Most likely it's something like low comment downvotes to attract attention to the story.)\nMy first thought was that the numbers had a hidden meaning as a puzzle or respect, maybe someone died who invented the equivalent of a Fibonacci sequence. Looking in the OEIS, 1,4,6,12,18 did not mean anything obvious (http://oeis.org/search?q=1%2C4%2C6%2C12%2C18). Then I noticed the numbers changed... but not pseudorandomly, but with the stories, so it seems that the numbers are irrelevant. Is it about the title? If you read the first title character of each, you get LCHPL. If you read the 1st character of the first, the 2nd character of the 2nd, etc., you get LAWKN. Not yet seeing that hidden meaning.\nEdit: To everyone saying a hot indicator, I thought of that and it doesn't seem to make sense. E.g. go to page 3 and observe this one being black:\n> 4 points by [user] 7 hours ago\nThere are currently (22:47 UTC) actually 3 black on the third page, which seems a bit inconsistent with what I saw earlier (earlier: first page had 4, next page had 1, next page had 0).\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29524781\nPoints: 80\n# Comments: 27",
