For example - DList is created to be consumed partially & in a lazy fashion, while Acc is created to be a builder type that goes into full normalization to be converted into a storage type (like Vector or Seq). So every type has its own domain of application & haskell-perf/sequences currently has not enough benchmarks to show all particularities of types under different conditions of use.\n As I opened: 1.

          "description": "Hi, we were trying to figure out an ideal way to represent Semver. There are a few ways we've tried representing semver however each has its drawbacks. Here are the 3 possible implementations we've considered each of them have drawbacks:\n  \nSimple data type data Version Natural Natural Natural\n \nSum type data Version = Major0Minor1Patch0 | Major0Minor2Patch0 | Major1Minor0Patch0 | Major1Minor1Patch0\n \nUse a sum type on each major minor patch version. This is the approach we are currently taking: ```haskell data Patch = Patch0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)\n \n data Minor = Minor0 | Minor1 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)\n data Major = Major0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)\n data Version = Version { major :: Major , minor :: Minor , patch :: Patch } deriving (Generic, Eq, Show) ```\n Requirements:\n Serialization/deserialization via aeson\n Complicated pattern matching\n This is important with event sourcing as some consumers may not care about minor version changes only major version changes.\n If we have a new major version and we don't handle it then we want to fail to compile.\n 1: Wouldn't give us strong compile-time guarantees. I don't know all actual versions we have.\n 2: Forces us to handle all versions even if the consumer does not care. I don't have a way to say I only care about Major versions.\n 3: Lets us handle only major version changes, and we know all possible major versions. However, we are representing a product and can introduce versions that don't really exist. e.g. if we have 0.1.0, 1.0.0, 1.1.0 then if we create a 1.2.0 we are now also representing 0.2.0.\n I'm curious if anyone has an alternative representation that might be better.

What gets confusing is from a Wikipedia article on Algebraic data types :\n  \nIn set theory the equivalent of a sum type is a disjoint union, a set whose elements are pairs consisting of a tag (equivalent to a constructor) and an object of a type corresponding to the tag (equivalent to the constructor arguments).\n  \nThe disjoint union article was fairly understandable, but I'm not making the connection between my List above and this quote above about tags and constructors and constructor arguments. Nice if someone could shine some light on this for me.\n    submitted by    /u/teilchen010  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Data.Vector.Unboxed essentially gives a Structure of Arrays representation - Vector (a,b) can be stored as (Vector a, Vector b). \n This has some minor issues - deriving doesn't really work, writing the typeclass by hand is really annoying, GHC cannot optimize away dead reads if you only use one field - but overall it's a reasonably nice and composable abstraction.\n I'm currently playing with some code which accepts messages and must store them efficiently before they get batch-executed. To make this extensible I'd like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.\n But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn't matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.\n This lead me to a number of questions:\n  \nIs there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?\n Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational\n Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -> Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values\n Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like\n  \n \ntype ExtractPII<Type> = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; \n If people have ideas to any of these points I'd really like to hear about them!\n    submitted by    /u/Tarmen  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a Python developer who got into Haskell because of Cardano, when learning this language, I could still see that Haskell, despite being very different, shares quite a lot similarities with Python. \n As a practice and a form of learning reinforcement, I created a project, py2hs, to document how some frequently used programming patterns (e.g. functor, applicative) are implemented in Python and Haskell respectively. If you are a Python developer who just started learning Haskell, hope you can find this material helpful in some way.\n In terms of future development, I will keep improving existing contents and adding more examples as time allowed. Also, any contributions from the community is more than welcome. Hope we can together make it a better learning material and help more Cardano developers!\n Jerry\n    submitted by    /u/jc__xyz  \n [link]   [comments]",

Due to this technological advantage, their business model allows them to provide a service to a demographic of people who are seen as non-viable clients to traditional banks, the un-banked. However, these emerging markets have access to cell phones and global telecommunication systems which puts them in the same realm as me, a rando in the US with some dollars that I don't immediately need for anything. So, rather than leave this money in a savings account, which gives me back little to nothing. I've used some of my liquidity to buy some ADA in the hopes that eventually, Cardano will become a major player in the world of micro-finance for the \"developing world.\" News about their deals in Africa give me much encouragement as these are the places that would greatly benefit from stable currencies.\n Essentially, I think of it like Uber, which connects people that need rides with people that have cars. Cardano connects people who have liquidity with people that need money. Yes, the blockchain will take its cut, but it will loan money to the un-banked at a less predatory rate than they currently have access to and will give me a higher return on my money than a savings account. Am I wrong in thinking this way? Help me understand.\n    submitted by    /u/salvador_ii  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I started to research some opportunities to invest in DEX and DeFi on cardano before they go live.\n I stumbled upon multiple posts here that mention SundaeSwap as one of the potential winners. Then I tried to make my research and the result puzzled me quite a bit.\n First of all on the official site team consists of 1 lead engineer, 1 smart contract engineer and 3 frontend engineers. I'm a software engineer myself and it seems that it's really not enough to develop such a big project that implies a lot of backend work. I guess this page could be outdated though.\n So I started to look at their github repositories and I could not find any smart contract that should be deployed to cardano network. Also I don't see a lot of activity in the repositories and most of them are just forks (copies) of the other open source code. From what I've seen it doesn't seem to me that the release date is close.\n So here is the questions part. Does anyone have any additional info about the progress? Maybe I overlooked some information or found a wrong repository.\n What do you think?\n    submitted by    /u/nakedpony  \n [link]   [comments]",

Absolutely not, because Cardano has different goals than other crypto currencies. Their goal is it to work with countries, banks and companies - not small DeFi or DApp developers.\n Meaning the whole development on ADA goes slower, but it's safer, better for professional use and to put it simply: future proof\n    submitted by    /u/Sisyphusarbeit  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey crypto people :)\n I've been hearing a lot about how Haskell is \"hard\" and devs won't develop on it because of this.\n I would like to give my thoughts on this:\n First, the truth. Haskell is hard. In more broader terms, functional/Declarative languages are hard/less intuitive then the imperative ones (Java/Python/etc...) and we can't ignore this fact.\n BUT the thing is...\n It probably won't matter in the long run. Why? Because this project is huge. The funding is huge and also the trust and the community. And thus, people will go where the money is. Do you really think people will care when there are multiple dexes/loans protocols/PTE games/etc... that they are written in Haskell? No they won't. They want to make money. Period.\n For example, Bitcoin is also very very tough the develop on (due to the utxo model and the weird scripting language it has). This didn't (and doesn't) stop countless developers to develop on it (myself included). Do you know why (I guess you do by now :) ) ? Because the community, trust and money are there and I think that this will probably be the case for Cardano as well.\n Also, I might be wrong :) Just my 2 cents.\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/omrip34  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Decentralization at team level vs. protocol\n Distributed networks and decentralization are concepts much older than Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto proved that it was possible to create decentralized value that people could own, share and transfer without a middleman. In doing so, he laid the foundation for the entire cryptocurrency industry, or if you prefer, blockchain networks. Every public blockchain network needs native coins to enable decentralization itself. Coins may play a different role in each project, but they have one thing in common. It is necessary to ensure their fair distribution.\n Imagine you want to start a new decentralized project. What do you need?

The block size would have to be about 8MB and no changes in how cardano deals with transaction for it to be a worry.\n ​\n What´s your opinion on this?\n    submitted by    /u/Easy-Dust-3129  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can’t even talk half the time to these types without feeling like I’m sacrificing my true opinions.\n Nope. I don’t see the rest the crypto comunity liking us very much because we are not the type of people to just pretend, and put all of our money on ‘red’ or ‘black’. \n I do think that there are a lot of non Cardano holders of great projects. But damn it seems like Main Stream crypto folks are no different than the guys I play craps with at the casino. This is why I think we get hated on so much. We’re just not like them. \n I hope I don’t seem too arrogant but that’s my point. I guess when you look at life a few moves ahead of the other guy then you do come off as arrogant. So be it...

          "description": "From what little bit I have read on different blockchain scaling solutions, Cardano’s Hydra solution is the best out of all the “Ethereum Killers” because it addresses all known issues with blockchain scaling. Right now, Cardano has a much lower transaction throughput than Solana for example, but I don’t like the way Solana achieves their high throughput because I think that their method of electing leader(s) to generate a proof of history and then broadcast the PoH to the rest of the nodes in the respective cluster leaves them vulnerable to DDOS attacks like the one that caused them to need to restart their network after a period of being shut down. I really love how Algorand has been able to achieve near instant finality for layer one transactions (: wicked fast sending from Coinbase to …",

I'm looking for an honest, coolheaded discussion about the Voltaire era.\n My understanding is that the more ADA you have, the larger your voting power. That is to say, the more money you have, the more power you can exert over the future of Cardano. So a few rich people will have a strong effect on what propositions reach the ballot (for lack of a better term) AND on the outcome of the vote. Does anyone find this concerning? Am I oversimplifying?\n Assume there exists a proposition that has short-term/long-term tradeoffs. Is there any mechanism to prevent institutions and whales from ramming through a shortsighted vote, cashing out, and leaving Cardano in a worse state in the long run?\n It's the classic \"two wolves and a lamb voting on what to eat for lunch\" scenario.

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n Can someone please enlighten me about slot leader and input endorsers?\n From searching docs, I find the following:\n \"Slot leaders operate in epochs to listen for and confirm transactions to produce blocks, which are then approved by input endorsers. A Cardano input endorser is the second set of stakeholders that verifies transactions included in blocks. It’s believed this design is scalable since the network can increase the number of slots per epoch and run multiple epochs across the network simultaneously.\"\n Does that mean that: 1) Sufficiently saturated (but not oversaturated) stake pools get a high chance of randomly selected as slot leaders for a certain epoch.\n 2) Non-selected stake pools get given a role of \"input endorser\" for this epoch. Or does this mean delegators using a \"heavy client\" such as Daedalus? \n Additional questions: *What does it mean to increase the number of slots per epoch? Add more stake pools, while reducing the saturation point per pool? *How exactly does this increase transaction speed or capacity? \n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/AlertElderberry  \n [link]   [comments]",

After receiving a rather generic answer at first, they followed up personally, asking for a qualified contact at VeriTree.

          "description": "I'm not going to lie. When I first got into Cardano I did not understand Blockchain tech or my country's monetary system. After months of research. I think I can hold my own in a pretty extensive discussion about Cardano and where I see this ecosystem going. I'm extremely excited about the tech and partnerships on Cardano but there is one part of all this that I just don't understand the hype. Non - fungible tokens particularly. I was never a collector of art, I never collected anything to be honest, but I found myself towards the beginning of my crypto journey obsessing over non- fungible token projects. I would skim the Cardano Kidz website and get excited about each series that was coming out. Then when it was time. I would choke. I just couldn't do it. I couldn't spend my hard earned money on a picture. I couldn't justify it, to myself or my wife. I thought to myself... Why was I so excited in the first place? I don't collect things? I've never collected shit in my life. What made me so excited about this art? Well as I thought about it, I've come to a conclusion. The truth is I don't understand the hype. I was more excited about the tech behind non- fungible tokens then I was about the actual picture. I see the value in its verifiability and how revolutionary that verifiability is. But I'm not an art collector. I never was, and I felt kinda stupid for acting like I cared to be one. I'm happy people are using the Cardano blockchain, but I realized something today. \n I just don't care as much as I thought I did about these current Non fungible tokens.\n    submitted by    /u/MiddleFix9783  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did it, and paid the fee for doing so.\n Now the Yoroi wallet balance reads: \n  \nTotal ADA e.g. 11, Total rewards 0 and total delegated ADA e.g. 11.\n  \nThe problem is that switching back to Daedalus, all I see is Total ADA e.g. 11.\n In other words, according to Yoroi, my wallet's rewards do not compound automatically: I have to pay a fee in order to add the earned rewards to my stake-pool-delegated principle.\n So... what's going on?

The trade off with using this device is I don’t want to lose all my Ada and still want to be more secure. But having to get my ledger every time will stop me from transacting as much or using Ada in the future.\n Solution Introduce skimming. What if there was a two wallet system that managed the trade off between both security and transacting.\n  \nImagine two wallets: Wallet Savings Account and Wallet Transaction Account\n…",

I noticed almost all the projects I see have a certain allocation (sometimes a big one) for VC money to get in before the rest of us. I’m sure there are reasons, but it’s always a major turn off for me. It doesn’t feel fair that institutional investors get in early at a lower price just because they are rich. Even projects using ISPO’s still take VC money. I thought the point of an ISPO was so that they could raise funds without having to go that route. \n Is there something I’m missing here?

Obviously not with the huge amount to the founder, but something more fair, and with a website where people can see a graph of penalties paid. I really like the pumpamentals. People buy and stake to prevent dilution, and people who don't stake are diluted, which means that stakers will have a larger percentage wise amount of tokens. And if people unstake too early, then stakers win even more, because of the penalties paid for unstaking too early. Also very limited supply, so the price can skyrocket, which will give an incentive to unstake early(to sell the token), which means more penalties paid and more for stakers. What's not to like?\n Please someone make this.

          "description": "I've had a little fling going on for the past month. It started out as a hookup, then turned into hooking up a couple times a week, then hooking up every other day for the past two weeks. Heading in the direction of something more and I really like her.\n She's going home for Thanksgiving, and we hung out before she left. We were in the kitchen eating a snack as I was getting ready to leave, when one of her friends came in to say goodbye. She knows the two of us are hooking up but I'd never met any of her friends before. We all made small talk for a few minutes but I really did have to go. I was debating whether I should kiss her goodbye in front of her friend but I didn't want to come on too strong, but also didn't want to not do it since I always kiss her goodbye. Said fuck it and just went for it, just a peck on the lips, nothing crazy. She walked me out and gave me another kiss where her friend couldn't see. The door closed, and I paused to pull out my headphones, when I heard the two of them squealing like little schoolgirls (it's not that weird, we're only seniors in college).\n Hopefully it was the good kind of squeals lol\n Life is good and I feel like im like 15 again :)\n    submitted by    /u/TurbulentRecording72  \n [link]   [comments]",
