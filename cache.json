To make this extensible I'd like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.\n But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn't matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.\n This lead me to a number of questions:\n  \nIs there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?\n Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational\n Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -> Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values\n Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like\n  \n \ntype ExtractPII<Type> = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; \n If people have ideas to any of these points I'd really like to hear about them!\n    submitted by    /u/Tarmen  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a Python developer who got into Haskell because of Cardano, when learning this language, I could still see that Haskell, despite being very different, shares quite a lot similarities with Python. \n As a practice and a form of learning reinforcement, I created a project, py2hs, to document how some frequently used programming patterns (e.g. functor, applicative) are implemented in Python and Haskell respectively. If you are a Python developer who just started learning Haskell, hope you can find this material helpful in some way.\n In terms of future development, I will keep improving existing contents and adding more examples as time allowed. Also, any contributions from the community is more than welcome. Hope we can together make it a better learning material and help more Cardano developers!\n Jerry\n    submitted by    /u/jc__xyz  \n [link]   [comments]",

The trade off with using this device is I don’t want to lose all my Ada and still want to be more secure. But having to get my ledger every time will stop me from transacting as much or using Ada in the future.\n Solution Introduce skimming. What if there was a two wallet system that managed the trade off between both security and transacting.\n  \nImagine two wallets: Wallet Savings Account and Wallet Transaction Account\n…",

I noticed almost all the projects I see have a certain allocation (sometimes a big one) for VC money to get in before the rest of us. I’m sure there are reasons, but it’s always a major turn off for me. It doesn’t feel fair that institutional investors get in early at a lower price just because they are rich. Even projects using ISPO’s still take VC money. I thought the point of an ISPO was so that they could raise funds without having to go that route. \n Is there something I’m missing here?

          "description": "Is anyone creating some version of HEX on Cardano? We need this! Or at least we should have it. Obviously not with the huge amount to the founder, but something more fair, and with a website where people can see a graph of penalties paid. I really like the pumpamentals. People buy and stake to prevent dilution, and people who don't stake are diluted, which means that stakers will have a larger percentage wise amount of tokens. And if people unstake too early, then stakers win even more, because of the penalties paid for unstaking too early. Also very limited supply, so the price can skyrocket, which will give an incentive to unstake early(to sell the token), which means more penalties paid and more for stakers. What's not to like?\n Please someone make this. It is way better than stupid meme tokens, and I guess kinda easy to make compared to other projects. :-)\n    submitted by    /u/Good-Book-6912  \n [link]   [comments]",

Saw someone shaming people for hoping Bezos’ penis rocket exploded, asking us “how would you feel if it was your rocketship” without a hint of irony. \n By far the worst tho are people who assume that anyone who hates rich people is just jealous of them.\n Anyway, billionaires aren’t human and their heads belong on spikes. I sincerely hope we break out the guillotine for them in my lifetime.\n Kill the rich. They aren’t human and they don’t deserve our kindness or sympathy.\n    submitted by    /u/bussyboyfourtwenty  \n [link]   [comments]",
