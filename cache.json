To do so, I intend to prepare a minimal case that reproduces the issue on the compiler version that the GHC developers would most prefer. I'm having trouble doing that though:\n 1) Which is the GHC version that would be the most useful for GHC developers? 8.10.7, the one the majority of the users currently use (me included)? 9.2.1 which is the latest stable release? Or GHC HEAD? \n 2) Unless the answer to (1) above is GHC 8.10.7, what's the easiest way to obtain that GHC version, very preferably without polluting my system globally? I've built GHC HEAD using the great nix-shell provided by https://github.com/alpmestan/ghc.nix, which allowed me to build it without installing any system dependencies globally. But I can't figure out how to run the resulting GHC, I have ./inplace/bin/runghc which I can use to interpret .hs files and I have ./inplace/bin/ghc-stage2, but that one results in a billion linker errors when I try to compile anything. I've also tried installing GHC versions via ghcup, but that one also fails because I think I'm supposed to install some system dependencies, but I really don't like doing that if at all possible.\n It might be a good idea to update the report a bug page in the GHC wiki with this information. This subreddit is probably not the best place to ask these questions, but I'm also not sure where best to engage with the GHC developers.\n Thanks for any pointers!\n    submitted by    /u/enobayram  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone, as a means to learn Haskell I've decided to write a very basic Web3 implementation in it, everything has been great so far but I'm having a really hard time trying to encode integers that are greater than 8 bytes because of the data types. I've come across some useful libraries but settled on using Data.Binary. Here's an example of something I want to do in Elixir:\n ```elixir\n This just gives you a 32 bytes representation of that number\n <<3214000000000000000000::signed-256>>\n  \n<<0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 174, 59,\n  \n53, 195, 127, 137, 120, 0, 0>>\n ```\n On Haskell I've tried and it works with smaller numbers (Whatever fits into Int64), but with bigger ones:\n ```haskell\n B64.encode $ BL.toStrict $ runPut $ putInt64be 3214000000000000000000\n <interactive>:61:48: warning: [-Woverflowed-literals]\n Literal 3214000000000000000000 is out of the Int range -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807\n \"AAB4iX/DNTs=\"\n ```\n Which does not give me the correct representation since the value is out of bounds (I think the number it sticks with is 4266531174538018816 (maxBound :: Int64) rather than the one I passed)\n ​\n So, I wanted to ask, what are my options to encode these numbers in the same way I can do on the first Elixir example? Is there a technique I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/Aguxez  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "During last five years it was twice that I had to figure out how parse JSON in streaming fashion. I figured that I release a library, so I don't have to figure it out again some years in the future. I suspect this library might be useful to others too, since it is likely that I am not the only who ran into such problem. In my particular situation use cases were:\n  \nParse a very large JSON file, contents of which was one very big top level dictionary with millions of key value pairs. My requirement was that I needed to modify each individual key/value pair without affecting memory overheaad.\n Continuously parse an infinite stream of log entries from a service called logentries.com where each entry was formatted as JSON and delimited by a newline.\n  \nconduit-aeson is capable of handling both of these use cases and probably others as well. See haddock for examples and documentation. Here is one such example:\n ```\n  \n  \n:set -XOverloadedStrings :set -XTypeApplications import Conduit let input = \"{ \\\"foo\\\": 1, \\\"bar\\\": 2, \\\"baz\\\": 3 }\" runConduit $ yield input .| conduitObject @String @Int .| printC (\"foo\",1) (\"bar\",2) (\"baz\",3) ```\n  \n  \n   submitted by    /u/kuleshevich  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So a common critique on Cardano is that there are not many Haskell developers. While this ' might' be true, it's a false critique I think. Because in that line of reasoning it's: the more programmers there are, the more apps will be built, the more network, the higher the price. However, people do not need 10 times every application. They need a GOOD application. Therefore, once a sufficient amount of programmers that can do Haskell is found to do the fundamental apps and protocols well, it's a logic of diminishing returns. *Simply put, enough developers to do the job, is just as good, as 10 million to do the job.* Agree?\n    submitted by    /u/Delicious-Stage-8341  \n [link]   [comments]",

Charles has complained about it in his videos, but also not really gone into the arguments against it as far as I could find. So I tried to outline the arguments against burning ADA, and would be curious to see if you agree with my arguments and if you have anything to add. This is the comment I just posted under his video:\n One last attempt to explain why Cardano REALLY doesn't need burning.

Are there really fewer people mining bitcoin than are staking cardano?\n For #2: what does he mean by \"consensus participant\"? Is that like a full node operator? I find it hard to believe more people are running cardano full nodes than bitcoin full nodes. How fast does the cardano blockchain grow in size? Since it is so fast and feature-rich, will cardano blockchain remain small enough for plebs to run it in their homes?\n For #3, what does he mean? Does he mean because of governance tokens? So source code changes can be hired out by the treasury and fork decisions can be voted on?

          "description": "Charles Hoskinson has revealed Cardano's plans for 2022. In a 30-minute Christmas Eve chat on YouTube, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson reflected on the current state of the industry and the Cardano network. Some plans for the project for next year were also made. Hoskinson said the following: “There was a tweet from 2020 where I said, 'I predict we'll have thousands of dApps and hundreds of Assests on Cardano by next year.' I'm wrong both ways.” According to him, instead of hundreds, more than two million assets have now been issued on the Cardano network. The majority are reportedly NFTs. As for the expansion of decentralized applications (dApps) on the network, however, Hoskinson said, \"we have yet to see significant traction there.\" He claimed that this was due to the delayed release of the Goguen update. The release introduced smart contracts to the network. Right now i am bullish on a few projects like: Rise up, ATRI, PKT and Spores. Im very glad I've found them.

          "description": "Hello smart people,\n We're wanting to do something innovative in education, an NFT version of ePortfolio. Meaning that a submission (i.e. for credit) would comprise some images (at least three, all unique) and text files (at least two); all of these files would be related and best displayed together. Ideally it'd be the public could see and buy one public-facing image, which would be associated with four or five other files. \n The real-world analogy is a portfolio; you're an assessor and someone hands you a binder of work the student has done and needs to be evaluated on. You need to see every page in the binder, and there also needs to be a way for you to acknowledge your read it and sign it off. We're assuming it'd involve NFT but that may even be wrong, or more likely not the whole story. I.e. there are ePortfolio softwares out there, could they be linked to Cardano?\n I understand typically when creating an NFT, you enter the ipfs ID number of the (jpg) file into a field, but that's only linking the one jpg.\n Could anyone suggest how we might go about setting this all up? My mind is boggling at the creative possibilities; unfortunately my knowledge and skill in all these parts lags far behind. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/don1too  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had not spoken to my father since I was 10. I only found out about his passing by googling his name and discovering his online obituary. I don't even know how he died, I just hope he was at peace. During this time my mother was hospitalized with severe cognitive decline after suffering cardiac arrest. I never told her, she was so confused about anything I tried to speak to her about. It would have been cruel to abruptly deliver the news that her former husband of almost 25 years no longer existed. She left about a week later, I stayed with her when they took her off the ventilator. I am the only person in my peer group who has experienced this, and I don't want to alienate them by dwelling on it. I have no siblings or other close family members. I don't even know how to think or write about it. It viscerally repulses me to vulgarize their memory by posting about it anonymously on reddit but it haunts me so much and I lack other avenues. I tried counseling until I couldn't afford it and it left me completely hollow. I kept hearing it gets better with time but it hasn't in my experience, I miss her so much.

          "description": "the drive-thru window is raised up really high, and the cute baristas completely tower over me in my tiny Mazda. I pull up, and I’m forced to look upwards– inferiorly–into their pretty, over-caffeinated eyes. And what do they give me? A look of expectation, a look of want. We both know what’s happening. A transaction is about to occur, and I’m on the short end. $3.11 for a “venti” Americano–oh yeah, my cheeks are being clapped here.\n Then comes the best part: they demand that cash. “Three eleven.” I love it when it comes out bluntly, like they’re annoyed they even had to ask. Don’t hit me with the pleasantries, no ma’m. Peer at me and simply make your decree. Shoot daggers into me from above that mask. What am I going to do about it from all the way down here?\n I have no choice but to comply. And I mean none! I am legally obligated to hand it over. I look up with my wide deep blues, and meekly hold out my card in my final act of submission. Please, take it. Deplete my bank account. Take everything I’ve ever worked for. \n They hand me a cup of hot dirty water, and I drive away with a dumb, wry smile. Everyone wins. I mean, I’ve lost for sure. But really, I won.\n    submitted by    /u/rhombuspusher  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\nI've just had a bizarre thing happen and wanted to see if the HN community could come up with some theories as to what happened.\nLastPass blocked a login attempt from Brazil (it wasn't me). According to an email I received from LastPass, this login was using the LastPass account's master password. The email doesn't look like it's a phishing attempt.\nWhat troubles me is that the master password was stored in a local encrypted KeePassX file.\nI can imagine that someone has my KeePassX file and the (completely different) password to this file. If that's the case, I'm in a world of hurt.\nBut are there any other possibilities? Is the email from LastPass accurate i.e. was the login attempt actually using my master password? Is there some LastPass extension installed on some computer still having a valid auth token allowing them to login as me to LastPass..?\nI'm really confused, and scared.\nThanks for your help.\nP.S. The LastPass account had 2FA set up, but I was able to simply remove it (since I didn't have access to the token anymore). That's scary too -- what's the point of a 2FA you can remove...??\n---\nUpdate:\n- the email was truly not phishing -- the same information regarding the login attempt appears in my LastPass dashboard. I also talked to LastPass support over the phone, and they confirmed seeing the same information.\n- There are 2 separate users in the thread below confirming that the same exact same thing happened to them, from the exact same IP range as me.\nEither the 3 of us had the same malware/Chrome extension or somehow had our master passwords compromised...? Or...? Is this a LastPass issue?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29705957\nPoints: 485\n# Comments: 264",
