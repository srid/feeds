I do not see how to do this. Where / how do I run ghci to import this? I can see the Haskell file in src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs, but import AOC.Run.Interactive fails with ghci run in either the top level or down in src. If I :l src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs I get Illegal lambda-case (use LambdaCase), but I didn't think that was the right thing in the first place. I assume I'm missing something simple and obvious here? - The \"Executable\" section of the documentation says I should be able to get a plain old runnable executable aoc-dev. How do I get this?

One of the biggest topics for Artano was, and still is KYC.\n We would love to hear your opinion about our KYC procedure, and KYC in general on Cardano and how we can improve it through this Google Form. \n Thank you, we really appreciate your input and let us know if you have any specific questions in the comments. This is just the beginning of the KYC conversation on Cardano, and specifically how can we bank the unbanked AND abide to regulatory changes that are coming to the crypto world. \n Here's the form link, thank you very much and stay awesome!\n https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BcTy4lT9wX-F_GYtwyV6AIIKrMxgMjTk0kf5d0nGdcc/edit\n    submitted by    /u/artanoio  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm seeing so many fud posts of people complaing about daedalus performance.\n Of course the correct answer is that if they are not a cryptoanarchist willing to sacrifice their computer performance for helping the health of the ecosystem and bickering about it instead, theay should jsut use a light wallet like a normal mainstream person. We will still probably have more than enough full nodes running around the world from people willuing to do that, so we don't need everyone to do it.\n So even if recommending Daedalus to everyone might seem like a good idea helping the health of the network, it might be doing more damage than help in the adoption and make people who don't realize the difference between light and full nodes hate Cardano. The light wallets exist for a reason. They might think this is the issie only with it because other blockchains are already past the point of recommending full nodes as the first options to everyone. Heck, most people have theirt bitcoin in custody already I think.\n So let's stop putting Daedalus as the first recommended wallet, we should still mention it, but warn about it's consequences and inform what using it means together with such recommendation. But for some reason, most tutorials for newbies on how to use Cardano only recommend Daedalus with no warnings or explanations. That's just hurtful...\n There's already enough fud as it is, we don't need to shoot ourselves in the foot giving them even more ammo like this.\n    submitted by    /u/CatacombsOfEgress  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "UPDATE: this appears to be a general issue with counting transactions of an address. Not exactly sure which page counts what exactly still but it seems to be general for cardano addresses. It might be the difference of whether an address only counts outcoming vs. incoming and outcoming transactions. But I'd have to confirm this first. We should also think about what this implies when comparing contract volumes... \n We have seen a stark rise in Smart Contract usage recently and I was curious how many transactions the most used Smart Contract so far had.\n I found MusliSwap, reporting that they had crossed 50k interactions recently on twitter:https://twitter.com/MuesliSwapTeam/status/1472740442999595014\n This seems reasonable, as only recently they were confirmed to be far ahead with only 30k interactions.\n Now I checked cardanoscan, the address they gave and can confirm that at the time of writing it is already beyond 50k (at 59k)https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1wy2mjh76em44qurn5x73nzqrxua7ataasftql0u2h6g88lc3gtgpz\n I wanted to cross-check and went to adapools...https://adapools.org/address/addr1wy2mjh76em44qurn5x73nzqrxua7ataasftql0u2h6g88lc3gtgpz\n They have already 74k transactions there. So they certainly crossed 50k and seem to have taken the minimum of both counts, which is very cool to see (a dApp truly coming to live!)\n But what still grinds my gears: How can this huge margin occur? Do the websites count differently? What could make the difference in the way they count?\n    submitted by    /u/nielstron  \n [link]   [comments]",
