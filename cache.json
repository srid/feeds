          "description": "Hello everyone, as a means to learn Haskell I've decided to write a very basic Web3 implementation in it, everything has been great so far but I'm having a really hard time trying to encode integers that are greater than 8 bytes because of the data types. I've come across some useful libraries but settled on using Data.Binary. Here's an example of something I want to do in Elixir:\n ```elixir\n This just gives you a 32 bytes representation of that number\n <<3214000000000000000000::signed-256>>\n  \n<<0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 174, 59,\n  \n53, 195, 127, 137, 120, 0, 0>>\n ```\n On Haskell I've tried and it works with smaller numbers (Whatever fits into Int64), but with bigger ones:\n ```haskell\n B64.encode $ BL.toStrict $ runPut $ putInt64be 3214000000000000000000\n <interactive>:61:48: warning: [-Woverflowed-literals]\n Literal 3214000000000000000000 is out of the Int range -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807\n \"AAB4iX/DNTs=\"\n ```\n Which does not give me the correct representation since the value is out of bounds (I think the number it sticks with is 4266531174538018816 (maxBound :: Int64) rather than the one I passed)\n ​\n So, I wanted to ask, what are my options to encode these numbers in the same way I can do on the first Elixir example? Is there a technique I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/Aguxez  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "During last five years it was twice that I had to figure out how parse JSON in streaming fashion. I figured that I release a library, so I don't have to figure it out again some years in the future. I suspect this library might be useful to others too, since it is likely that I am not the only who ran into such problem. In my particular situation use cases were:\n  \nParse a very large JSON file, contents of which was one very big top level dictionary with millions of key value pairs. My requirement was that I needed to modify each individual key/value pair without affecting memory overheaad.\n Continuously parse an infinite stream of log entries from a service called logentries.com where each entry was formatted as JSON and delimited by a newline.\n  \nconduit-aeson is capable of handling both of these use cases and probably others as well. See haddock for examples and documentation. Here is one such example:\n ```\n  \n  \n:set -XOverloadedStrings :set -XTypeApplications import Conduit let input = \"{ \\\"foo\\\": 1, \\\"bar\\\": 2, \\\"baz\\\": 3 }\" runConduit $ yield input .| conduitObject @String @Int .| printC (\"foo\",1) (\"bar\",2) (\"baz\",3) ```\n  \n  \n   submitted by    /u/kuleshevich  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\nI've just had a bizarre thing happen and wanted to see if the HN community could come up with some theories as to what happened.\nLastPass blocked a login attempt from Brazil (it wasn't me). According to an email I received from LastPass, this login was using the LastPass account's master password. The email doesn't look like it's a phishing attempt.\nWhat troubles me is that the master password was stored in a local encrypted KeePassX file.\nI can imagine that someone has my KeePassX file and the (completely different) password to this file. If that's the case, I'm in a world of hurt.\nBut are there any other possibilities? Is the email from LastPass accurate i.e. was the login attempt actually using my master password? Is there some LastPass extension installed on some computer still having a valid auth token allowing them to login as me to LastPass..?\nI'm really confused, and scared.\nThanks for your help.\nP.S. The LastPass account had 2FA set up, but I was able to simply remove it (since I didn't have access to the token anymore). That's scary too -- what's the point of a 2FA you can remove...??\n---\nUpdate:\n- the email was truly not phishing -- the same information regarding the login attempt appears in my LastPass dashboard. I also talked to LastPass support over the phone, and they confirmed seeing the same information.\n- There are 2 separate users in the thread below confirming that the same exact same thing happened to them, from the exact same IP range as me.\nEither the 3 of us had the same malware/Chrome extension or somehow had our master passwords compromised...? Or...? Is this a LastPass issue?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29705957\nPoints: 485\n# Comments: 264",
