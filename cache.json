I have successfully connected the joy cons and I'm reading the input in the stepping function (6th argument of play - called periodically) instead of the event handling function (5th argument), as the latter only recognizes keyboard and mouse input.

Please communicate your intent on the PR itself so if there are others who want to also work on it, you don't have to duplicate their work.\n There's another new tool in this same space, Stack Lint Extra Deps. The maintainer was kind enough to get on a phone call with us on Monday to discuss pros and cons of working on SLED vs Renovate, and the consensus is we'd all like to see Renovate support Haskell first.

Please excuse me if this sounds really stupid as I have a little coding experience. I had a questions which I wasn't sure where to ask about. \n Let's just say I had 100 NFTs minted and sent to 100 different wallets as a raffle ticket to win a PS5. I select the winner and announce that its #11 NFT. Now let's say person A is the winner and DMs me and say she has the winning NFT. How can I actually verify this person is the #11 NFT holder? \n Because I'm thinking that lets Person B sees the announcement before person A, so person B looks up the #11 NFT on cardanoscan and see all the necessary information to pretend like Person A? \n So I'm thinking the only way to verify the winner is if Person A send shipping information and is it only confirmed when Person A send back the #11 NFT(winning) back to me so I know it's that person wallet and I ship out the winning prize. Is that the logic? I feel like I'm overcomplicating things.\n    submitted by    /u/Aclrsy  \n [link]   [comments]",

From a programmer perspective, I have to say this is really elegant, hands down to the ADA team for their approach. \n Is it possible to simulate the so-called ERC20 \"tokenomoics\" on ADA however? How can one add \"on transfer fees\" or \"automatic redistribution\" on every transfer? \n I hope my questions are not to trivial and really appreciate that you took the time just to read this.

I've succesfully set it up, sent my ADA to it, but now I'm trying to access it from my second PC. I have all the needed stuff (name, phrase, PWs), but when I go to recover the wallet, in the last step it asks me to input a new password. For now, I used a Phantom wallet and it allowed me to log in normally with phrase and a password, on Yoroi it seems like its asking for a new password. If I enter a new password, I'm guessing I'll get logged out of my first PC? I'm fairly new to wallets and DEXes so it might sound noobish but...is it even possible to have Yoroi logged in on multiple machines?\n Thanks in advance and all the best during the holidays!\n    submitted by    /u/LeFabio  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also another question, with Gens, they're pools fee is 99% + the standard 340; so does that basically mean I won't be getting Ada rewards except for the 1%, but get gens tokens instead?\n    submitted by    /u/Peach_Air  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Why i thought of this is due to majority of people here afraid of : what will happen if I die? How i can have kyc (know your customer) attached so Ada can be transferred to family member. How to use it offline at merchant without having access to wallet or internet while travelling ?\n So what could be done is engage governments and existing banks into Crypto currency structure. \n Users can get paper print from bank from their fiat or crypto currency savings account. For eg. I have 100 Ada in my account and I am traveling to other country i can take out print of 50 Ada scannable code or passkey to use that amount of Ada where merchant can just scan it via their app and customer can pay with this paper rather than Cash. Merchant can accept in Ada or in fiat directly via this page and relative fiat conversion charges can be applied. \n Other than this all Ada account holders can have Pager like device for OTP which will be connected via satellite so even if someone has paper they can't utilise without using this pager device + transaction password by customer. \n Also via Ada wallet it will always require this OTP plus password to start transaction. Customer can get new pager of old is lost or stolen via bank or verified partners. Meanwhile Bank branches which partners with Ada foundation will host their own stake pool as well. Many other things can be added to this basic functionality. \n This is only for those who don't mind submitting their KYC and identity.\n    submitted by    /u/throwaway2020future  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In one of his many long videos this year, Charles smartly mentioned that decentralization is a \"volume knob\", the application of which the EUTXO model of Cardano nicely allows for.\n Let's think back to the concurrency FUD related to the different DEX rollouts on Cardano. Ergodex I believe created a solution that relies on a proprietary, centralized \"Ergodex back-end\". This solution was critized for being centralized, because the DEX wouldn't work if the back-end solution was DDOS'ed, for example.\n What people fail to see, however, is that this is precisely the \"volume knob\" Charles mentioned, in action. The EUTXO model allows for everything non-essential to be moved off-chain, with the final important confirmation happening on-chain. I am fine with a back-end solution to help with batching off-chain. In addition, once the number of DEXes grows it becomes highly unlikely that all of them would be DDOS'ed at once. Not to mention that pure on-chain solutions are likely to exist too and have simply not been discovered yet due to how new EUTXO is for devs. They are likely to come.\n This is the trade-off vs account-based models. I for one welcome with open arms centralized back-end solutions for DEXes as long as the final confirmation of trades happens on-chain, on the best POS network in crypto. This same logic allows for the insane scaling of Hydra, too, I believe. You trim the fat.\n What are your thoughts on EUTXO generally? I personally believe we are simply going through growing pains, and after a few years EUTXO will be the gold standard as account-based models still struggle with fees, certainly with the predictability of them. In short, I have a good feeling.\n    submitted by    /u/Cadenca  \n [link]   [comments]",

Check out this Fund7 proposal to improve the platform.\n - We raised +8200 ada selling NFTs and we will now use that to fund community proposals, thanks to our \"Iteration 0\".\n - We count with 24 SPOs of the region (9 different countries) taking part in this process.\n - We truly built a community from scratch in less than 1 year.\n ‚Äã\n All this would have been impossible without YOUR PARTICIPATION: whether if it was joining a Fog√≥n at 1 AM in the morning, retweeting , commenting on Discord or buying an NFT.\n THANK YOU!!!\n ‚Äã\n Finally, our plans for 2022 are:\n - Continue growing our community (check out our Fund7 proposal)\n - Continue creating services and trying to generate more and more opportunities for the region\n - And, of course, keep taking Cardano to the next level\n ‚Äã\n ‚Äã\n Thanks to everyone.

I am not really sure where to start with this. but essentially me and a group of friends have purchased a theatre and most of the surrounding buildings in a town on the west coast USA. I can't really give away the whole plan yet, but we have pretty big things in the works to create a very large music/culture/event venue. We want to be one of the first venues to be built on the cardano blockchain, and I figured it couldnt hurt to reach out to the community! We are looking for ideas to incorporate cardano into our project, as well as possibly help with the publicity that we hope to capitalize on by using cryptocurrency in the new digital age! \n Thank you, cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/Pressure-Forsaken  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As an early adopter in Cardano, I was blessed to have decent bags as dapps get ready to launch. I'm no whale, more like jellyfish, but I still feel blessed.\n So this Christmas in recognition of dapps launching next year, I've decided to send all my personal friends who don't own Cardano or Crypto a ledger nano and 50 free ADA. Not promising them some get rich scheme, but giving free access to play and learn in the easiest project for introduction to the space.\n This is something I considered before, but it was always too complicated. Trying to explain to someone who doesn't feel they have the time what are gas fee's, polygon vs Ethereum networks, why so many different wallets, etc, etc was wayyy too complicated. Don't get me wrong, in true ape fashion, I jumped in and blew money playing around and made some gains in areas too. However, I could not expect that from friends or family. Cardano's native asset management through a single wallet address, security of the hard fork combinator with upgrades, and the coming dapp wave has finally pushed me to do this on a project in the blockchain space. Having them imagine that instead of a jpeg of nothingness, imagine that's just one of many health records or property housing deeds, credit worthiness or any other data we currently give to tens to hundreds of companies to store and expose to hacks.\n Anyways, thought it was a good idea for adoption, and wanted to share in case any other fortunate community members wanted to share their ideas and help push adoption through free, understandable introductions.\n Have a wonderful holiday season community, here's to 2022 üçªüçªü•Ç\n    submitted by    /u/Prestigious-Ad1576  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's all ready to be unleashed, once the PAB is released by Jan 2022.\n I personally made good ROI during the DeFi season in 2020 by aping in DEXes. Seems to have a very good R / R overall.

          "description": "In one of his videos on his YouTube channel, Charles Hoskinson once talked about a conversation he had with one of the creators of the internet. CH was basically reflecting upon the regrets the man expressed over designed decisions that had been made that were horrible and that have led to creating an internet with many vulnerabilities... and how he wanted things to be different for Cardano. \n CH then reiterated his commitment to ensuring that Cardano become a massive financial system that had to be built rightly from the start, so that when it is all said and done, he would feel differently about Cardano than what that man did about the internet. (The internet is to big now to make major changes to some of the past design decisions). CH doesn‚Äôt approve of the ‚Äúmove fast, break things‚Äù culture of the software culture. Ethereum, for example, is still figuring out how to deal with some of their past poor design decisions, just like that internet founder.\n Which brings me to this interview I‚Äôve been watching where the Charli3 team through their communication with IOHK had their code audited by a very reputable company. This allowed Charli3 to find issues early in their codebase. And even though none of the issues were devastating, they were important enough to merit revisions. CH is also intent on the creation of certification programs to give Dapps the option to vet their code to ensure a minimum standard of quality and safety. \n This may seem inconsequential now as Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem is still in the early days of its growth, but this is going to bring massive changes to the Dapp ecosystem in crypto in the long-run. And the quality of the Dapps on Cardano at launch will be high and likelihood of security flaws will be reduced significantly. This is going to be a huge game changer for the crypto space, and will be a major selling point for adoption and trust from users and businesses alike.\n    submitted by    /u/CanAmbitious5904  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyone is free to read the document (it's fairly short) but I will leave my own observations below.\n The document is broken in two demonstrations for methods to create \"crypto-anarchy\" or a government free currency. \n The first protocol describes Bitcoin with some prehistoric modifications: \n  \nCreation of money via solving a previously unsolved computational problem.\n Transfer of money via broadcasting the transaction to everyone on the blockchain.\n  \nThere is more general cryptocurrency ideas I'm choosing to skip over.\n This all makes sense considering the document is cited in Bitcoin's wallpaper. But, then the author offers another protocol. \n  \nUsing \"servers\" linked by a Usenet-style broadcast channel instead of peer-to-peer. \n I believe these resemble ADA's Staking Pools\n \n The servers agree on the amount of money (ADA) to be created during each period (Epoch).\n  \nThis post is nothing more than an observation I had while I was reading this document.

          "description": "I'm seeing so many fud posts of people complaing about daedalus performance.\n Of course the correct answer is that if they are not a cryptoanarchist willing to sacrifice their computer performance for helping the health of the ecosystem and bickering about it instead, theay should jsut use a light wallet like a normal mainstream person. We will still probably have more than enough full nodes running around the world from people willuing to do that, so we don't need everyone to do it.\n So even if recommending Daedalus to everyone might seem like a good idea helping the health of the network, it might be doing more damage than help in the adoption and make people who don't realize the difference between light and full nodes hate Cardano. The light wallets exist for a reason. They might think this is the issie only with it because other blockchains are already past the point of recommending full nodes as the first options to everyone. Heck, most people have theirt bitcoin in custody already I think.\n So let's stop putting Daedalus as the first recommended wallet, we should still mention it, but warn about it's consequences and inform what using it means together with such recommendation. But for some reason, most tutorials for newbies on how to use Cardano only recommend Daedalus with no warnings or explanations. That's just hurtful...\n There's already enough fud as it is, we don't need to shoot ourselves in the foot giving them even more ammo like this.\n    submitted by    /u/CatacombsOfEgress  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "UPDATE: this appears to be a general issue with counting transactions of an address. Not exactly sure which page counts what exactly still but it seems to be general for cardano addresses. It might be the difference of whether an address only counts outcoming vs. incoming and outcoming transactions. But I'd have to confirm this first. We should also think about what this implies when comparing contract volumes... \n We have seen a stark rise in Smart Contract usage recently and I was curious how many transactions the most used Smart Contract so far had.\n I found MusliSwap, reporting that they had crossed 50k interactions recently on twitter:https://twitter.com/MuesliSwapTeam/status/1472740442999595014\n This seems reasonable, as only recently they were confirmed to be far ahead with only 30k interactions.\n Now I checked cardanoscan, the address they gave and can confirm that at the time of writing it is already beyond 50k (at 59k)https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1wy2mjh76em44qurn5x73nzqrxua7ataasftql0u2h6g88lc3gtgpz\n I wanted to cross-check and went to adapools...https://adapools.org/address/addr1wy2mjh76em44qurn5x73nzqrxua7ataasftql0u2h6g88lc3gtgpz\n They have already 74k transactions there. So they certainly crossed 50k and seem to have taken the minimum of both counts, which is very cool to see (a dApp truly coming to live!)\n But what still grinds my gears: How can this huge margin occur? Do the websites count differently? What could make the difference in the way they count?\n    submitted by    /u/nielstron  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "from yesterday's thread\n was anxious all day, asked my OGBYN sister to take a look at pregnancy tests, which she thought were false positives. Then I got a new, electronic test from my ex, which confirms that yes, she is pregnant. I was in the grocery store with my mom getting stuff for Christmas, and had to ask to leave early bc I was basically having a panic attack. I told my parents, who reacted surprisingly well. Mom is sort of pissed and conspiratorial, talking about how my career is over and the pregnancy is fake and I am going to die in poverty or whatever, but my dad is actually pretty happy about a new grandchild. I was pretty anxious and felt sick all day, didn't eat anything and wanted to throw up\n but now that I talked to my dad for a few hours, and also called my ex and heard her on the line, some part of me is actually kind of happy. I would've wished to have gotten married beforehand, and I guess it would be nice to date, be stable, then get married, but tbh I'm so indecisive that I think I always would have had hangups and anxiety about anyone, so maybe it's a good thing that fate has forced the matter.\n assuming everything stays on track, I'm thinking I will marry her. she's kinda sorta crazy but mostly in a good way and the other stuff seems insignificant now. I figure that most people throughout human history get married in circumstances kind of like these, and that, even if they have problems going in, things will tend to work out. Or they don't work out, but life is still livable. Overall I really love this girl and am starting to see the happy side of things. Wish me luck and say a prayer for us\n    submitted by    /u/JAMohler  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I made a similar post last year at this time and, again, I am in my office on Christmas morning.\nThere are a few days every year that really show which jobs are vital and which can be left aside for a day.  I started my car this morning (-32, -40 with wind chill).  On my way to work I drove past a hospital and a care home, both were manned.  The dairy farm had its lights on.  A cop with his flashers drove past me on the way to some emergency.  The macdonalds drive-through was open too.  I had to be at work by 0600, but I was relieving someone who had been sitting in another office since 1800.  On my computer were the same dozen emails I get every morning, each from someone else who drew the short straw.\nThere aren't many of us on HN that work weekends let alone Christmas morning, but If you too are sitting in a dark office remember that all across the world are millions of other people working the truly important jobs.\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29683936\nPoints: 729\n# Comments: 160",
