Would this be accurate? And then the combinatorics product rule also seems at play here. I would appreciate any theoretical explanation of what a list comprehension is about.\n Edit: Looking at the Report I can see and understand the details, but somehow that list of facts in the \"Translations\" box implies, results in the Cartesian product. I'd like to know how and why.\n Edit 2.0: I guess I'm just trying to fathom what exactly a list comprehension is. The obvious answer is it's supposed to be some sort of set comprehension. But if a standard use of it is like this\n [(x,y) | x<-xs, y<-ys] \n producing the Cartesian product, then it's obvious the Cartesian product is built into this thing, i.e., that Haskell Report description is creating a Cartesian product machine with the ability to ad lib seeming non-binary relation Cartesian things when we want. So even if I do this\n [x+x | x<-[2]] [4] \n I'm still using (or bypassing most of) that same inherent Cartesian product mechanism. This gets silly\n [x+y | x<-[1..10], y<-[1..10], x == y, x == 2] [4] \n but yes, this is a Cartesian \"all possible combinations\" product, which is then filtered.

I haven't tried it, but, theoretically, that means you have (adaRate * (UTXO:walletAddress)) remaining in an address, which would suck because you're essentially saying if you process hundreds or even thousands of transactions on an address, there must be 1ADA left for each UTXO?\n Or if I were to try to transfer all the UTXO balances out, (--tx-in all of the UTXOs) as long as one remains with 1ADA that would be sufficient?\n I can write some of this today, it just sucks that you could possibly have hundreds if not thousands of dollars (ada * market rate) tied up in loose UTXOs.\n    submitted by    /u/shawnsblog  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm new to learning about Cardano. I've got a question about the interaction between native tokens and smart contracts - how can conditions be imposed on the transfer of tokens on Cardano?\n On Ethereum for example we know any token that isn't ether is a second class citizen and requires interaction with a smart contract to do anything. We know this has all sorts of disadvantages and introduces an overhead in terms of computation required on the EVM.\n But one advantage is that whilst settlement itself is computationally more intensive than needed, it would be very natural to impose conditions on the terms of settlement since that just requires augmenting the smart contract that already necessarily exists.\n How can conditions be imposed on Cardano when tokens are native citizens? Is there an elegant way to force the owner of a token to interact with a smart contract (and the computation layer) before settlement? \n Conceptually speaking, I would imagine the way to do this is to impose datums on every UTXO, then having that self-propagate onto the next UTXO when the transaction is built. But can this be codified at the time of minting? Because my understanding of the resources I've read so far only mentions minting policy, which seems to only concern things like minting and burning.\n Let's say I'm issuing tokens that contain the hashes for something that should be non-transferrable - a university degree, or some form of identification. On Ethereum I could simply write into the smart contract conditions to prevent me from sending the ERC-721 token out of my account. How can this be done on Cardano, and when and where would I need to enumerate these conditions?\n    submitted by    /u/MoleculesOfFreedom  \n [link]   [comments]",

But what in the instance of multiple payments for the same product?\n For example: If you have a product that you want to sell, say for 1 ADA (1,000,000 Lovelace), once you receive that, your rawUTXOTable (in this example) would always be positive...meaning if anyone else came along and bought that same product, listening for it would always say the purchase has been made.\n Now, I get it. A more complicated transaction would need to happen with metadata...but seems short sighted to not build the tutorial for this portion?\n ...I mean theoretically you could always add the UTXO you received initially to a list to avoid, but that only restricts you in one manner...*meh*\n    submitted by    /u/shawnsblog  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have recently began reading on the workings of cardano, its academic background and foundation and believe it has potential to be a great blockchain if not the best if more developers hop on board.\n So as a result I'm interested in learning how to develop cardano dapps, I know that Haskell is a non conditional prerequisite that one must learn to enter this space. What I would like to know is how much Lambda Calculus is truly need for me to know in order to create full functioning quality Dapps with Haskel. I will admit im not the strongest in math but I am capable of learning lambda if need be, I just need to know if it's something I MUST know in order to be a functional cardano dev.\n ​\n thanks in advance for any responses.\n    submitted by    /u/TheOddYehudi919  \n [link]   [comments]",

And there were many UI bugs that should have been fixed prior to a network scalability test (which is what I assume is the main reason to test on public testnet). Today, four days later, I came back to take another shot. Some things have been improved but still seeing many errors and have not seen a successful swap occur. The swap delay is concerning as that enforces the narrative on Cardano not able to handle concurrency.

Setting up Daedalus and choosing a stake pool was easy enough but how much more technical knowledge do I need to get involved with Sundaeswap?\n I want to do this for the airdropped Sundaeswap tokens and to delve a bit deeper into the Cardano ecosystem. AFAIK I need to download Nami? Then choose from a list of preselected stake pools who qualified for the ISO? Then I could also contribute to certain LP’s for additional airdropped tokens? Is this right? Did I miss the cutoff date? \n Is there anything I should be aware of that I’m missing? People said to wait for Yoroi to deploy but what is the benefit of this?

So i've decided to gift him a which wallet, which stakes and can be forgotten for years. \n My plan was to just sent ADA to the wallet, choose a staking pool through Daedalus or a other wallet, delete the software and gift him the private key. In 10 or 15 years he could use the money for his child. \n But ive red that staking pools vary on payout ratio, depending on how many people use it. \n Actually im fine with the APR going up and down a bit. Market should rule that right?\n But is it possible that a staking pool gets taken down? What happens then?

          "description": "I've never used a Dex and am relatively new to Defi, but as I lean more about how these Dexs work they don't seem to be decentralized at all. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems you need to use a centralized Web interface, controlled entirely by the team that produced it. They do the swaps off-chain (e.g. using a \"scooper\" on SundaeSwap), and then the final transactions are batched and recorded on the blockchain. So, it seems Cardano is only involved in the settlement process, not in the swap process.\n I envisioned a swap smart contract that accepted buy- and sell-order transactions, matched them up, and did the swap and settlement all autonomously. Users could submit these transactions using their wallet or the Cardano CLI. After the smart contract was published, the team that developed it could dissolve and the smart contract would remain and run indefinitely.\n Is the current centralization and dependency on a 3rd party team like SundaeSwap Labs just temporary while we wait for Hydra or other technologies on the Cardano network to be developed, or am I expecting too much?\n    submitted by    /u/JinShil  \n [link]   [comments]",

Besides SundaeSwap, there's Minswap, Maladex, Cardax, Ardana, Ergodex (but I've seen a few post regariding this dex in the past), Matrixswap, and Mirquir. I dunno If I missed one. All I know is Minswap is already done with their testnet but not sure about the other dexes.\n    submitted by    /u/implaying  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's extraordinary to me that when people are so close in philosophy and viewpoint, and in some cases technology, they can be so far apart as people. It's extraordinary.\n You don't see this in other industries. You don't see in physics or biology, or cellphone manufacturing, or whatever, pick an industry, the amount of tribalism, hate, and vitriol that our industry has for each other. And as long as we're doing that to each other, there's no reality where we're ever going to be able to overcome the real enemy, which is the legacy systems that hold three billion people and the human race down, destroy our environment, and divide us in ways that make us hate people we've never met and should never have grievances against.\n That has to stop. And the only way it's going to stop is if we get better systems that are more fair. And the only way we do that, is we have to work together. So, we'll see, 2022 whether that's accomplished. People will still try to divide us. Books will be published. Podcasters will say things. Reddit and Twitter will continue to pour rivers of verbal diarrhea. But it's up to each and every one of us to transcend that, step above it, and realize that we have a finite window.\n    submitted by    /u/EpicMichaelFreeman  \n [link]   [comments]",

Im really into Ada and try to participate in new projects like sundaeswap and right now im on the Testnet to get familiar wirh the upcoming mainnet… i have a small understanding what a dex is and what liquiditiy pools are for - but what i don’t understand is, why are there different types sundaeswap tokens? like choc, mint, sberry, rberry? what is the different between them and what is the difference in their value? if i pair choc and ada to a pool - why could this be better or worse compared to ada - rberry?\n hope you guys can help me out - i really dont get this 😬 Thx\n    submitted by    /u/Chekochbackhendl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just a few brief comments, some of our engineers worked with the sundae team to help optimize some of their scripts. We've been trying to extend this help to many DEXes and applications in the ecosystem.\n It's very important to understand that developing on Cardano is a new experience for the vast majority of the community and it will require some time for projects to fully understand, become productive, and deliver their DApps. The point of testnets are to provide early adopters and software developers a chance to iron out many issues that could impact quality, security, or user experience. Thus, by defintion, issues are expected, bugs should be encountered, and delays will happen. It's part of the process and I'm sure tbe team is hard at work chipping away at these things.\n    submitted by    /u/abu_alkindi  \n [link]   [comments]",
