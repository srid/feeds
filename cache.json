          "description": "I would like to model software APIs in a best-practice-functional-programming manner. I am wondering how professionals typically go about this problem. What are existing best practices, and so forth.\n More specifically, for my current project, I want to model several geometric primitives (e.g., circle, sphere, triangle) such that I can effectively reason about them and use effective type-checking. I will render them with different backends, and will handle that elsewhere (e.g., JavaScript), but I want to be sure I am effectively modeling the geometric types.\n I'd like to use Haskell.\n The obvious way to go about this would be to begin writing data types in Haskell and potentially use that to generate other code via Template Haskell. Is there a flaw with this approach? I've considered using XML, or using Haskell to generate XML as an intermediate, but I'm not sure if that's necessary or flawed in some way.\n In general, I'd also like to use whatever approach I develop to model systems in the future. I'm not sure what the best way of going about it is. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this, or can point me to some references, so that I don't begin coding something that is doomed to be suboptimal for reasons known to those who know.

          "description": "“OK, now let’s have some fun. Let’s talk about sex. Let’s talk about women. Freud said he didn’t know what women wanted. I know what women want. They want a whole lot of people to talk to. What do they want to talk about? They want to talk about everything.\n What do men want? They want a lot of pals, and they wish people wouldn’t get so mad at them.\n Why are so many people getting divorced today? It’s because most of us don’t have extended families anymore. It used to be that when a man and a woman got married, the bride got a lot more people to talk to about everything. The groom got a lot more pals to tell dumb jokes to.\n A few Americans, but very few, still have extended families. The Navahos. The Kennedys.\n But most of us, if we get married nowadays, are just one more person for the other person. The groom gets one more pal, but it’s a woman. The woman gets one more person to talk to about everything, but it’s a man.\n When a couple has an argument, they may think it’s about money or power or sex, or how to raise the kids, or whatever. What they’re really saying to each other, though, without realizing it, is this: “You are not enough people!”\n I met a man in Nigeria one time, an Ibo who has six hundred relatives he knew quite well. His wife had just had a baby, the best possible news in any extended family.\n They were going to take it to meet all its relatives, Ibos of all ages and sizes and shapes. It would even meet other babies, cousins not much older than it was. Everybody who was big enough and steady enough was going to get to hold it, cuddle it, gurgle to it, and say how pretty it was, or handsome.\n Wouldn't you have loved to be that baby?”\n    submitted by    /u/thecatholictouch  \n [link]   [comments]",
