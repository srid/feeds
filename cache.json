I have recently began reading on the workings of cardano, its academic background and foundation and believe it has potential to be a great blockchain if not the best if more developers hop on board.\n So as a result I'm interested in learning how to develop cardano dapps, I know that Haskell is a non conditional prerequisite that one must learn to enter this space. What I would like to know is how much Lambda Calculus is truly need for me to know in order to create full functioning quality Dapps with Haskel. I will admit im not the strongest in math but I am capable of learning lambda if need be, I just need to know if it's something I MUST know in order to be a functional cardano dev.\n ​\n thanks in advance for any responses.\n    submitted by    /u/TheOddYehudi919  \n [link]   [comments]",

Im really into Ada and try to participate in new projects like sundaeswap and right now im on the Testnet to get familiar wirh the upcoming mainnet… i have a small understanding what a dex is and what liquiditiy pools are for - but what i don’t understand is, why are there different types sundaeswap tokens? like choc, mint, sberry, rberry? what is the different between them and what is the difference in their value? if i pair choc and ada to a pool - why could this be better or worse compared to ada - rberry?\n hope you guys can help me out - i really dont get this 😬 Thx\n    submitted by    /u/Chekochbackhendl  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just a few brief comments, some of our engineers worked with the sundae team to help optimize some of their scripts. We've been trying to extend this help to many DEXes and applications in the ecosystem.\n It's very important to understand that developing on Cardano is a new experience for the vast majority of the community and it will require some time for projects to fully understand, become productive, and deliver their DApps. The point of testnets are to provide early adopters and software developers a chance to iron out many issues that could impact quality, security, or user experience. Thus, by defintion, issues are expected, bugs should be encountered, and delays will happen. It's part of the process and I'm sure tbe team is hard at work chipping away at these things.\n    submitted by    /u/abu_alkindi  \n [link]   [comments]",
