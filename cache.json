To make this extensible I'd like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.\n But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn't matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.\n This lead me to a number of questions:\n  \nIs there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?\n Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational\n Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -> Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values\n Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like\n  \n \ntype ExtractPII<Type> = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; \n If people have ideas to any of these points I'd really like to hear about them!\n    submitted by    /u/Tarmen  \n [link]   [comments]",
