          "description": "So i have this assignment where i have to code a game called \"Nim\" where two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps or piles, and the player that gets to remove the last object wins. I've already coded a function for doing a specific move, i.e : play [1,2,3,4] (3,2) = [1,2,1,4]. [1,2,3,4] would be the number of objects on each tile, and (3,2) would be removing 2 objects from the third tile. I also coded a function that gives a list of all the posible plays on a specific board position, i.e: possiblePlays [1,2,3] = [(1,1), (2,2),(2,1),(3,3), (3,2), (3,1)] The problem i'm having is that now i have to code a function that tells me if a board position (like [1,2,3,4]) is \"winnable\": a board position is winnable if a play exists that can lead to the other player getting a not winnable board position. i.e: isItWinnable [] = False (because you can't make another move, so you lose) isItWinnable [1] = True (because you get to remove the last object). I think these could be the base cases, but i'm having a lot of trouble thinking the recursion. I'm sorry for the long post and the messy english, it's not my native language and i had to translate everything from spanish. If anyone has any ideas or tips it would be greatly appreciated.

Basically the \"Stein\" has inside it all the other elements that are supposed to be above it. The \"Dach\" is the Roof and so it cannot take anything else above it. The correctness of the Structure is determined by the length of all the elements above a \"Stein\". So if it were that the total length of all elements above the \"Stein\" is smaller or equal to the Length of that \"Stein\" the Structure is considered Correct and true is given out. But I have no clue how I should continue from this point onwards. I have no clue how to verify the Length of all the structures above a \"Stein\" in such a way that still only Boolean comes out in the end.\n Edit: I did manage to come up with somewhat of a hacky solution to it which I am not really a fan of.\n correct :: Legu -> Bool correct x = 0 <= foldLegu (\\ le _ l -> if le >= sum l && sum l >= 0 then le else -le) const x \n Is there a more elegant way with which to do this, I am particularly not a fan of the fact I am simply giving out a negative number if the structure is not correct.\n    submitted by    /u/_Biological_hazard_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I will render them with different backends, and will handle that elsewhere (e.g., JavaScript), but I want to be sure I am effectively modeling the geometric types.\n I'd like to use Haskell.\n The obvious way to go about this would be to begin writing data types in Haskell and potentially use that to generate other code via Template Haskell. Is there a flaw with this approach? I've considered using XML, or using Haskell to generate XML as an intermediate, but I'm not sure if that's necessary or flawed in some way.\n In general, I'd also like to use whatever approach I develop to model systems in the future. I'm not sure what the best way of going about it is. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with this, or can point me to some references, so that I don't begin coding something that is doomed to be suboptimal for reasons known to those who know.

Her belief is that the vast majority of people who are (unfairly) called Anti Vaxxers are responsible, educated adults who are concerned about more reasonable issues, such the increased number of vaccines children are required to get, issues around personal autonomy and government overreach, or the lack of study of vaccines in combination with other preexisting conditions. She thinks the number of people who actually think that Fauci is the Antichrist and that the vaccines are microchips or whatever other crazy thing is vanishingly small. She does not believe any substantially large number of people would proudly call themselves “Anti Vax”. I am of the opinion that it’s the other way around, I think most people who have any criticism of vaccines are on the more extreme end of things, and are fairly likely to also believe in QAnon or Trump being sent by god, and it’s actually the logical, measured and thoughtful vaccine “questioners” who are in the minority.

          "description": "“OK, now let’s have some fun. Let’s talk about sex. Let’s talk about women. Freud said he didn’t know what women wanted. I know what women want. They want a whole lot of people to talk to. What do they want to talk about? They want to talk about everything.\n What do men want? They want a lot of pals, and they wish people wouldn’t get so mad at them.\n Why are so many people getting divorced today? It’s because most of us don’t have extended families anymore. It used to be that when a man and a woman got married, the bride got a lot more people to talk to about everything. The groom got a lot more pals to tell dumb jokes to.\n A few Americans, but very few, still have extended families. The Navahos. The Kennedys.\n But most of us, if we get married nowadays, are just one more person for the other person. The groom gets one more pal, but it’s a woman. The woman gets one more person to talk to about everything, but it’s a man.\n When a couple has an argument, they may think it’s about money or power or sex, or how to raise the kids, or whatever. What they’re really saying to each other, though, without realizing it, is this: “You are not enough people!”\n I met a man in Nigeria one time, an Ibo who has six hundred relatives he knew quite well. His wife had just had a baby, the best possible news in any extended family.\n They were going to take it to meet all its relatives, Ibos of all ages and sizes and shapes. It would even meet other babies, cousins not much older than it was. Everybody who was big enough and steady enough was going to get to hold it, cuddle it, gurgle to it, and say how pretty it was, or handsome.\n Wouldn't you have loved to be that baby?”\n    submitted by    /u/thecatholictouch  \n [link]   [comments]",
