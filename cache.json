          "description": "Now that I have used backpack in raaz which has internally simplified the package quite a bit. However there are some ergonomic issues in their use at-least in raaz.\n  \nFirstly, I am not sure why backpack performs the mixing and matching in the .cabal file. I feel it makes the .cabal file rather large and unwieldy. The raaz.cabal is close to 900 lines of code with no real way to split it up. It is probably one of the biggest file in the repository\n \nThe documentation story is not very nice. Say Module A which depends on Signature Sig in an internal module. Now suppose the top library wants expose a version of A with some module mixed in for Sig, all the documentation of the functions defined are lost. One can solve this as this can be seen here. https://github.com/raaz-crypto/raaz/blob/master/raaz/Raaz/Digest.hs Documenting the functions in the source module (A in this case) is not useful because it is not visible one has to repeat this again in the outside exposed module. Whereas writing the documentation close to the function definition (in module A) make more sense.\n \nMismatch between documentation for hackage vs created by cabal haddock.\n \n I think 2,3 are probably bugs, or there is a way to handle it that I do not know about, but 1 is a design choice. It is curious because ghc supports .bkp files which is not recommended though. Currently .bkp files are only used to include test cases in ghc the compiler or to demonstrate backpack.\n    submitted by    /u/piyushkurur  \n [link]   [comments]",

This can be in response to a request for advice or just something that you think could be generally useful for many people here.\n \nEncouragement. Probably best directed at specific users, but if you feel like just encouraging people in general I don't think anyone is going to object. I don't think I really need to say this, but just to be clear; encouragement should have a generally positive tone and not shame people (if people feel that shame might be an effective tool for motivating people, please discuss this so we can form a group consensus on how to use it rather than just trying it).\n \n    submitted by    /u/AutoModerator  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm working my way through the selfish gene, and realize that there's a foundation for social cheaters that's based on the mathematics of game theory, which suggests that rational actors will be self interested, and therefore you can expect that repeated situations will resolve neatly to what can be described as rational self-interest. \n However, it does not seem to be the case that people are actually rational actors - in fact, they're mostly intuitional actors, who will follow their gut feeling even in the face of a life and death decision. It's hard to imagine someone actually being able to be rational when in a full on fight or flight reaction. \n So then game theory doesn't actually work to describe most circumstances. Even John Nash himself walked back on it, suggesting that it doesn't actually work to describe society (citation: interview with Adam Curtis in The Trap). The dominance of a corporation that is degrading the environment doesn't seem to be described by game theory, since the rationally self-interested actor wouldn't destroy the environment. \n Makes me think of what John Coase called \"blackboard economics,\" where rather than studying what happens in the real world, highly artificial, controlled environments are used to create models. \n What's an alternative to game theory? Is there one? Can we imagine one, if there isn't?\n    submitted by    /u/qqqqquinnnnn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This weekly roundup thread is intended for all culture war posts. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people ever change their minds. This thread is for voicing opinions and analyzing the state of the discussion while trying to optimize for light over heat.\n Optimistically, we think that engaging with people you disagree with is worth your time, and so is being nice! Pessimistically, there are many dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to become unproductive. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup - and if you think you find it easy…",
