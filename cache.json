I've tried using parMap to evaluate the next the potential moves and their costs in parallel. But this has only made my program slower. Is there something wrong with my approach?\n I'd also like to run the actual path finding recursion with all candidates (or the best two) at the same time but I've heard this isn't really possible due to the function returning an IO(). Is there anything I can do to make this part of the program go faster?\n Ideally I want something like this:\n for each state in possible_future_states: new thread(target=BFS, args=variables updated with this state being chosen) \n Thank you for reading this. Any advice is greatly appreciated.\n ‚Äã\n EDIT:\n This is my current attempt\n https://pastebin.com/8sMRCxR6\n    submitted by    /u/Commie1984  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "TLDR: My wallet has too many UTXOs associated with it and I cannot submit transactions to the blockchain anymore - the ADA and native assets are locked in the wallet, unable to be sent. In theory, couldn't people mint 1000s of junk NFTs and flood people's wallets with unwanted UTXOs - essentially locking their ADA and other assets in place?\n FULL STORY: I've been handling the minting for a CNFT project - we minted about 3k tokens at launch and then sales died down. Our policy locks in May so we decided to create a holding wallet and mint the remaining 7k just to be safe.\n 1: First, I created a holding wallet with 1 single payment address through the CLI - I run a full node on AWS. I didn't even think about creating more than 1 address at the time. You can view the wallet here https://cardanoscan.io/address/0104e59e0c56f2f3629bbc42d66c64983c45011578e807f8d06b11a250c402b98bb1020ac3c8a529e1e65b1dd0d6c1afba265d613b12b54813\n 2: I began minting tokens and sending them to the holding wallet. 331 in total were minted before discovering the issue.\n 3: I discovered the issue when a customer purchased one of the tokens that had been stored in the holding wallet. When I tried to send them the token - the following error was thrown... \n  \nCommand failed: transaction submit Error: Error while submitting tx: ShelleyTxValidationError ShelleyBasedEraAlonzo (ApplyTxError [UtxowFailure (WrappedShelleyEraFailure (UtxoFailure (MaxTxSizeUTxO 17214 16384)))])\n  \nIssue: Basically I can't submit transactions - the associated 331 UTXOs render any transactions too large to be submitted.\n Vulnerability: While this is a bummer for our project and customers, it made me think - couldn't nefarious parties target any wallet by simply minting and sending 300-400 junk NFTs to the address? The wallet would run into the same problem.\n Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm not an advanced user by any means so I'm hoping I'm just missing something here.

Not sure why there is a token needed for it when artists can just create NFTs.\n Genius Yield (GENS): Yield optimizing sounds cool. The team gets 18% of the supply, and there is a 3% public presale. Lars Brunjes is the director of education at IOG so this is probably a solid project.\n IAMX: Claim to be an identity/authentication solution for web 3. Interesting they partnered with MELD but I don't really understand what they are doing that Atala Prism won't...\n Maladex (MAL): Whitepaper looks long and well written, a little over my head. Interviews on Cardano 360 episodes were pretty good. I guess I like that they have options for pools that‚Ä¶",

          "description": "I'm mid-thirties working in Software/Data Engineering. I've been working at different companies during the last decade, and currently making ~$120k, and hitting no more than 40h/week.\nI don't consider myself especially intelligent. Neither I'm dumb. I suffer from imposter syndrome from time to time, especially when I start a new job/challenge. I usually acknowledge these situations and manage to drive them without major problems. I have been in places where I was making way more but the job was boring, in startups where I was learning x10 every single day, I cut my salary to join especially talented teams, I stayed at places that required less than 10h/week while being paid for 40h... Sometimes I have been focused on pursuing a bigger salary, a promotion, or becoming a manager. I successfully accomplish most of these challenges. Every single situation had pros and cons, and none of them made me feel completely full-filled.\nI thought I had a pretty good work-life balance but lately, I've been through health issues and every single doctor/therapist is pointing out to stress and sedentarism. Due to that, I've been reading some articles where researchers explain how people in tech started to care more about happiness and less about salary. I thought I was already doing that but looks like I've been doing something wrong with my professional career, and there is a path more equilibrated and focused on happiness I should follow.\nDo you do something special?\nComments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29614095\nPoints: 292\n# Comments: 215",
