To make this extensible I'd like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.\n But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn't matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.\n This lead me to a number of questions:\n  \nIs there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?\n Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational\n Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -> Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values\n Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like\n  \n \ntype ExtractPII<Type> = { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; \n If people have ideas to any of these points I'd really like to hear about them!\n    submitted by    /u/Tarmen  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a Python developer who got into Haskell because of Cardano, when learning this language, I could still see that Haskell, despite being very different, shares quite a lot similarities with Python. \n As a practice and a form of learning reinforcement, I created a project, py2hs, to document how some frequently used programming patterns (e.g. functor, applicative) are implemented in Python and Haskell respectively. If you are a Python developer who just started learning Haskell, hope you can find this material helpful in some way.\n In terms of future development, I will keep improving existing contents and adding more examples as time allowed. Also, any contributions from the community is more than welcome. Hope we can together make it a better learning material and help more Cardano developers!\n Jerry\n    submitted by    /u/jc__xyz  \n [link]   [comments]",

While we are still waiting for the ERC20-converter to finally go live, SingularityNETs first spinoff project SingularityDAO just had its debut as launchpad yesterday. Being the DeFi-arm of the SingularityNET-ecosystem, SingularityDAO will launch every upcoming Snet spinoff project. The first project that launched yesterday is Nunet, a decentralized compute project. One of the goals of Nunet is to provide the computing ressources for the whole ecosystem - running endless AI agents and eventually the creation of an AGI (artificial general intelligence) will take a lot of ressources. And what's better than an in-house decentralized compute project? There are already…",

I was never a collector of art, I never collected anything to be honest, but I found myself towards the beginning of my crypto journey obsessing over non- fungible token projects. I would skim the Cardano Kidz website and get excited about each series that was coming out. Then when it was time. I would choke. I just couldn't do it. I couldn't spend my hard earned money on a picture. I couldn't justify it, to myself or my wife. I thought to myself... Why was I so excited in the first place? I don't collect things? I've never collected shit in my life. What made me so excited about this art? Well as I thought about it, I've come to a conclusion. The truth is I don't understand the hype. I was more excited about the tech behind non- fungible tokens then I was about the actual picture. I see the value in its verifiability and how revolutionary that verifiability is. But I'm not an art collector. I never was, and I felt kinda stupid for acting like I cared to be one. I'm happy people are using the Cardano blockchain, but I realized something today. \n I just don't care as much as I thought I did about these current Non fungible tokens.\n    submitted by    /u/MiddleFix9783  \n [link]   [comments]",

Recently, i read that you could get your cardano working for you by a method called \"staking\".\n How can i \"stake\" my cardano thought Metamask? I cannot find anything related :(\n I was thinking about using another wallet, but metamask was the only available wallet i could use with Trezor T and Binance Smart Chain tokens like cardano. If you know another wallet where i can stake my cardano and works with Trezor T, please tell me.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Ezxio_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did it, and paid the fee for doing so.\n Now the Yoroi wallet balance reads: \n  \nTotal ADA e.g. 11, Total rewards 0 and total delegated ADA e.g. 11.\n  \nThe problem is that switching back to Daedalus, all I see is Total ADA e.g. 11.\n In other words, according to Yoroi, my wallet's rewards do not compound automatically: I have to pay a fee in order to add the earned rewards to my stake-pool-delegated principle.\n So... what's going on? Which one of the two representations of the same wallet is true? The Daedalus one?

The trade off with using this device is I don’t want to lose all my Ada and still want to be more secure. But having to get my ledger every time will stop me from transacting as much or using Ada in the future.\n Solution Introduce skimming. What if there was a two wallet system that managed the trade off between both security and transacting.\n  \nImagine two wallets: Wallet Savings Account and Wallet Transaction Account\n…",

I noticed almost all the projects I see have a certain allocation (sometimes a big one) for VC money to get in before the rest of us. I’m sure there are reasons, but it’s always a major turn off for me. It doesn’t feel fair that institutional investors get in early at a lower price just because they are rich. Even projects using ISPO’s still take VC money. I thought the point of an ISPO was so that they could raise funds without having to go that route. \n Is there something I’m missing here?

The board game will be a series of different games that all use the same statistics and players can use characters between the games. With the App, it will be used to keep players statistics through the game but the reason I am posting it here is because I am looking at using NFTs on Cardano so that players can purchase new characters on the app. This will let players play the board games with your NFT characters. Maybe later also bring them to video games.\n Cardano NFTs\n In using NFTs some characters will be rare and some will be common and even some unique, players can buy, trade and sell their ch…",

Obviously not with the huge amount to the founder, but something more fair, and with a website where people can see a graph of penalties paid. I really like the pumpamentals. People buy and stake to prevent dilution, and people who don't stake are diluted, which means that stakers will have a larger percentage wise amount of tokens. And if people unstake too early, then stakers win even more, because of the penalties paid for unstaking too early. Also very limited supply, so the price can skyrocket, which will give an incentive to unstake early(to sell the token), which means more penalties paid and more for stakers. What's not to like?\n Please someone make this. It is way better than stupid meme tokens, and I guess kinda easy to make compared to other projects. :-)\n    submitted by    /u/Good-Book-6912  \n [link]   [comments]",
