 Recently, after following a guide and installing haskell and necessary stuff from here, I tried to compile a small program and found out that I needed to install LLVM, I did it and by trial-and-error I managed to get everything working, but though it works, if I run GHCi I get this message.

One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined. objc[67464]: Class AMSupportURLSession is implemented in both /usr/lib/libamsupport.dylib (0x1f8097180) and /Library/Apple/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileDevice.framework/Versions/A/MobileDevice (0x107c74318). One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined. 
 *edit: just after posting this, when I launched GHCi again, this didn't happen, but yesterday at first this took place, then it didn't and today it did again
 Do you know what's responsible for it? What should I do?

 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/changelog
 Please give it a try. Here is a cabal.project template: https://gist.github.com/Bodigrim/9834568f075be36a1c65e7aaba6a15db
 This work would not be complete without a blazingly-fast UTF-8 validator, submitted by Koz Ross into bytestring-0.11.2.0, whose contributions were sourced via HF as an in-kind donation from MLabs. I would like to thank Emily Pillmore for encouraging me to take on this project, helping with the proposal and permissions. I'm grateful to my fellow text maintainers, who've been carefully reviewing my work in course of the last six months, as well as helpful and responsive maintainers of downstream packages and GHC developers. Thanks all, it was a pleasant journey!

 Who should apply?
 Anyone who meets the following criteria should apply:
  
Candidates should have enough bandwidth to review merge requests to base on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month), and sustain this for their 3 years term in a healthy manner.
 Candidates should be able to contribute opinions and analysis to issues raised by the community as a part of the CLC proposal process on a semi-frequent basis (2 to 3 per month).
 Candidates should be good communicators, and at least be able to articulate to the CLC team when they will be available vs. unavailable.
 Candidates should be productive, and be able to follow through on merge requests and conversations to their completion in a diligent and timely manner.
  
We encourage any and all who satisfy these requirements to apply. Please note that we are not looking for the biggest galaxy brain in the room - quite the opposite. We are looking for productive, motivated individuals who want to help support the ecosystem that we love. As such, we hope to build a broad sample of the community.
 Candidates, who stand for CLC Elections back in September, are most welcome to apply again.
 How can I apply?
 To apply for one of these positions, send an email to [core-libraries-committee@haskell.org](mailto:core-libraries-committee@haskell.org) that consists of the following data:
  
The header "CLC Election January 2022 - {your name}".
 Why you think you’re a good fit given the above criteria.
 If applicable, please point us to some code you’ve written.
  
Please apply before Feb 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When providing a type to users, a library can also provide lenses for that type without actually depending on lens. This is because Lens is a type synonym, so you can simply write a function with the correct signature and export it, to be used like a Lens. And even though there is a wide variety of lens packages (lens, optics, microlens, etc.) such a function is likely to work with most of them.
 This is all preamble to my actual question: how can a library do the same for streams? There are a number of streaming libraries out there (conduit, pipes, streaming, streamly, etc.) and a hypothetical library author would might like to provide streams or stream combinators to users that are compatible with as many of them as possible, but don't explicitly rely on those libraries. Does anyone have any information about what this could look like (assuming its even possible)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Game made with apecs and gloss crashes when trying to read input from Nintendo Switch.
 Inspired by this post, I am recreating the Unity 2D tutorial in Haskell using apecs and apecs-gloss. I am nearly done: The graphics are rendered correctly, the levels are generated appropriately, the player responds to keyboard input, etc.
 As an extra, I want to be able to control the game with the Nintendo Switch joy cons. I have successfully connected the joy cons and I'm reading the input in the stepping function (6th argument of play - called periodically) instead of the event handling function (5th argument), as the latter only recognizes keyboard and mouse input. Here is an excerpt of what I'm doing in the step function, the full details of handleSwitch can be seen here (essentially read input if the buttons are pressed when the stepping function is called, interpret the input and update the scene).
 stepGame :: Float -> C.System' () stepGame dT = do ... ASTM.forkSys (Switch.handleSwitch dT) ... 
 Unfortunately, the player may respond to the first few inputs but then the game crashes. I thought it was a race hazard so I wrapped handleSwitch in forkSys (creates a new thread for switch input) but the issue persists.
 Any ideas on what might be going wrong and how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why i thought of this is due to majority of people here afraid of : what will happen if I die? How i can have kyc (know your customer) attached so Ada can be transferred to family member. How to use it offline at merchant without having access to wallet or internet while travelling ?
 So what could be done is engage governments and existing banks into Crypto currency structure. 
 Users can get paper print from bank from their fiat or crypto currency savings account. For eg. I have 100 Ada in my account and I am traveling to other country i can take out print of 50 Ada scannable code or passkey to use that amount of Ada where merchant can just scan it via their app and customer can pay with this paper rather than Cash. Merchant can accept in Ada or in fiat directly via this page and relative fiat conversion charges can be applied. 
 Other than this all Ada account holders can have Pager like device for OTP which will be connected via satellite so even if someone has paper they can't utilise without using this pager device + transaction password by customer. 
 Also via Ada wallet it will always require this OTP plus password to start transaction. Customer can get new pager of old is lost or stolen via bank or verified partners. Meanwhile Bank branches which partners with Ada foundation will host their own stake pool as well. Many other things can be added to this basic functionality. 
 This is only for those who don't mind submitting their KYC and identity.

So stakepools for their ISO have been announced last month and they said that ISO and DEX will be launched together so I guess there is still time. But would there be a date upto which we can stake with these pools to earn Sundaeswap tokens or I have to stake right now? From where the time will be counted, from the date of the pool selection or from the future date when they will announce ISO?
 And before anyone pointsout, I did post this in Sundaeswap subreddit but didn't receive any answer.

If we use a stable coin that is stable because it follows the US-Dollar or the Euro, doesn't that mean that this same stable coin gets affected from inflation and everything else? And if so are the only true stable coin options the one that reflect gold as a value?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, First time experience running Haskell, I wanted to spend some time learning the fundamentals during these holidays break. 
 I installed the Stack installer for windows to a Win10 core i5 (late 2019) laptop with 8 gigs of ram. I then proceeded to create an 'hello world' project - - stack downloaded GHC 8.10 and created a cabal file (very confused between cabal and stack differences but, I'll go with the flow). 
 The machine behaves well with other programing platforms. however, with Haskell/stack it seems very slow... I'm running stack build and stack test and it takes up to 1 minute in both cases if there is any change to compile (without recompilation, still takes about 30 secs).
 Was just wondering if this slowness is expected? I remember using it on a Ubuntu machine and didn't notice it being so slow. Maybe it has to do with the underlying C compiler arch?

 An update for SingularityNET holders, Cardano enthusiasts, and those who are interested in joining.
 Some further good news for AGIX this December: Its ERC-20 converter test-net is now live and operable. This is cool news, and as usual with Cardano partners - impressive technology. Although it probably won't get too much use in these crazy market conditions. https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/12/07/the-agix-erc20-converter-testnet-is-now-live/?s=09
 Also Airdrop for AGIX holders - NTX tokens incoming. snapshot of wallet addresses on Jan 5th - 2022.

 Hosting the AI data marketplace of the Cardano ecosystem is a monumental task. Airdrop potentials in these massive future-looking projects are so dope to me. ADA is a behemoth - and this is how it will interact with AI - through AGIX and its accompanying system of tokens like SDAO and NuNet (NTX).
 Hope all the Cardanians, and everyone else a very excellent end of the year and Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Hannukah, and Winter Solstice to all of you.

 Pretend I bought 100 ADA coins.
 I stake them. And continue to earn 5% interest.
 I am assuming I won't get tax, since I didn't really achieve capital gain (I achieve capital gain when I sell into fiat USD?)
 Anything else I need to know regarding taxes specifically dealing with Cardano?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am a Cardano enthusiast trying to mint some NFTs on the Cardano network and test some of its functionalities out. Please excuse me if this sounds really stupid as I have a little coding experience. I had a questions which I wasn't sure where to ask about. 
 Let's just say I had 100 NFTs minted and sent to 100 different wallets as a raffle ticket to win a PS5. I select the winner and announce that its #11 NFT. Now let's say person A is the winner and DMs me and say she has the winning NFT. How can I actually verify this person is the #11 NFT holder? 
 Because I'm thinking that lets Person B sees the announcement before person A, so person B looks up the #11 NFT on cardanoscan and see all the necessary information to pretend like Person A? 
 So I'm thinking the only way to verify the winner is if Person A send shipping information and is it only confirmed when Person A send back the #11 NFT(winning) back to me so I know it's that person wallet and I ship out the winning prize. Is that the logic? I feel like I'm overcomplicating things.

 I’ve been in the community for a while but this is my first post. I started to delegate ADA few epoch ago and joined a genius yield pool to earn some GENS.
 My question is: If the pool gets saturated, do we stop earning GENS? As far as I’m concerned, if a pool gets saturated you stop getting rewards. But in this case, being a 100% GENS reward, maybe is different. 
 Cheers and have a good one

 Firstly, sorry if i have gramaticals errors.
 I just finish a bootcamp of web development (mainly focused in Java), to into in context.
 Now
 I saw some post and articles talking about the great benefits of blockchain development, with positions from 6k to 12k.
 Looking for more info, too i saw a lot of peolple treating the blockchain development as trash and saying that is overrated for the real world.
 AS a newbie in this circle, i would like hear more opinions from your.
 Thanks to everyone, regards from Argentina and Feliz Navidad.

 and yes, I did try to research this before asking.
 I really, really and I mean really want this to be a thing and think it would be game changing.
 EDIT: Let me clarify, I know stable coins are coming - what I'm trying to confirm is if we'll be able to swap from ADA to stablecoin like Djed from within the wallets.

 Q1
 Q2
 http://learnyouahaskell.com/ is a resource listed in the sidebar of this sub. Is this book really outdated? If so what other similar book would you recommend? I come from a mobile development background (Swift) and for whatever reason, the format of this book makes it very approachable for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In one of his many long videos this year, Charles smartly mentioned that decentralization is a "volume knob", the application of which the EUTXO model of Cardano nicely allows for.
 Let's think back to the concurrency FUD related to the different DEX rollouts on Cardano. Ergodex I believe created a solution that relies on a proprietary, centralized "Ergodex back-end". This solution was critized for being centralized, because the DEX wouldn't work if the back-end solution was DDOS'ed, for example.
 What people fail to see, however, is that this is precisely the "volume knob" Charles mentioned, in action. The EUTXO model allows for everything non-essential to be moved off-chain, with the final important confirmation happening on-chain. I am fine with a back-end solution to help with batching off-chain. In addition, once the number of DEXes grows it becomes highly unlikely that all of them would be DDOS'ed at once. Not to mention that pure on-chain solutions are likely to exist too and have simply not been discovered yet due to how new EUTXO is for devs. They are likely to come.
 This is the trade-off vs account-based models. I for one welcome with open arms centralized back-end solutions for DEXes as long as the final confirmation of trades happens on-chain, on the best POS network in crypto. This same logic allows for the insane scaling of Hydra, too, I believe. You trim the fat.
 What are your thoughts on EUTXO generally? I personally believe we are simply going through growing pains, and after a few years EUTXO will be the gold standard as account-based models still struggle with fees, certainly with the predictability of them. In short, I have a good feeling.

 I have the Yori PC Version installed. If I download the app for my phone and restore using the seed I am hoping it will not have a negative effect on the wallet I already have set up. It would be nice to have a mobile version as well if possible. Is this possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[from yesterday's thread
 was anxious all day, asked my OGBYN sister to take a look at pregnancy tests, which she thought were false positives. Then I got a new, electronic test from my ex, which confirms that yes, she is pregnant. I was in the grocery store with my mom getting stuff for Christmas, and had to ask to leave early bc I was basically having a panic attack. I told my parents, who reacted surprisingly well. Mom is sort of pissed and conspiratorial, talking about how my career is over and the pregnancy is fake and I am going to die in poverty or whatever, but my dad is actually pretty happy about a new grandchild. I was pretty anxious and felt sick all day, didn't eat anything and wanted to throw up
 but now that I talked to my dad for a few hours, and also called my ex and heard her on the line, some part of me is actually kind of happy. I would've wished to have gotten married beforehand, and I guess it would be nice to date, be stable, then get married, but tbh I'm so indecisive that I think I always would have had hangups and anxiety about anyone, so maybe it's a good thing that fate has forced the matter.
 assuming everything stays on track, I'm thinking I will marry her. she's kinda sorta crazy but mostly in a good way and the other stuff seems insignificant now. I figure that most people throughout human history get married in circumstances kind of like these, and that, even if they have problems going in, things will tend to work out. Or they don't work out, but life is still livable. Overall I really love this girl and am starting to see the happy side of things. Wish me luck and say a prayer for us

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am new to the Cardano dev world and I am trying to draw a comparison between the ERC20 standard and the ADA Native Tokens.
 From what I've been reading so far, I understand that token transfers are natively supported by the ledger without the need of interaction with a smart contract directly. From a programmer perspective, I have to say this is really elegant, hands down to the ADA team for their approach. 
 Is it possible to simulate the so-called ERC20 "tokenomoics" on ADA however? How can one add "on transfer fees" or "automatic redistribution" on every transfer? 
 I hope my questions are not to trivial and really appreciate that you took the time just to read this. All the best!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's the end of the year and it's all about doing a balance: we want (and we need) to measure whether we had a good year or not.
 ​
 Luckily, in ALDEA, we have no doubt about this because during 2021:
 ​
 - We created aldeawiki.org, the Cardano encyclopedia: with the goal of explaining difficult concepts with short and easy-to-read articles. It's managed by a group of 18+ collaborators from our community and it is the first Wiki on our ecosystem. We have plans to onboard more languages, not only Spanish.
 - We launched the first version of ALDEA NFT Marketplace, and now we would like to give more and better services to our community, with the goal of becoming self-sustainable in the long run. Check out this Fund7 proposal to improve the platform.
 - We raised +8200 ada selling NFTs and we will now use that to fund community proposals, thanks to our "Iteration 0".
 - We count with 24 SPOs of the region (9 different countries) taking part in this process.
 - We truly built a community from scratch in less than 1 year.
 ​
 All this would have been impossible without YOUR PARTICIPATION: whether if it was joining a Fogón at 1 AM in the morning, retweeting , commenting on Discord or buying an NFT.
 THANK YOU!!!
 ​
 Finally, our plans for 2022 are:
 - Continue growing our community (check out our Fund7 proposal)
 - Continue creating services and trying to generate more and more opportunities for the region
 - And, of course, keep taking Cardano to the next level
 ​
 ​
 Thanks to everyone. From my heart.
 It's great to be part of this community: it's great to be part of ALDEA.

I am not really sure where to start with this. but essentially me and a group of friends have purchased a theatre and most of the surrounding buildings in a town on the west coast USA. I can't really give away the whole plan yet, but we have pretty big things in the works to create a very large music/culture/event venue. We want to be one of the first venues to be built on the cardano blockchain, and I figured it couldnt hurt to reach out to the community! We are looking for ideas to incorporate cardano into our project, as well as possibly help with the publicity that we hope to capitalize on by using cryptocurrency in the new digital age! 
 Thank you, cheers!

I’ve taken python which I found decent and enjoyable but I’ve heard mixed reviews about Haskell. I’m taking another programming class but I know myself and once it starts getting harder I might fall behind since I heard Haskell is extremely hard to learn. 
 I have about a month before classes resume and would love to do something productive with my time. So I’m wondering if anyone knows any good platforms or sites that do a really good job at teaching Haskell.
 Thanks in advance.

        <updated>2021-12-22T18:18:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am going through Typeclassopedia, and currently got stuck at the first set of exercises in the Monad section, namely the 3rd one:
  
Implement Functor and Monad instances for Free f, defined as data Free f a = Var a | Node (f (Free f a)) You may assume that f has a Functor instance. This is known as the free monad built from the functor f.
  
I got the Functor instance for Free f, but with my Monad instance I am getting this error when trying to load it into ghci:
 • Could not deduce (Applicative (Free f)) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: Functor f bound by the instance declaration at Freemonad.hs:22:10-36 • In the instance declaration for ‘Monad (Free f)’ 
 My guess is that that's due to this part in the monad definition in Control.Monad
  
class Applicative m => Monad m where
  
which it seems like it wasn't always there.
 So:
  
Is there some other way around it, or do I have to provide instance of Applicative for Free f first? Bonus question: should Typeclassopedia be updated to include this information?
 I can't figure out how to implement Applicative for Free f, any hints?
  
In case it matters, here is my Monad instance, that I have convinced myself on paper that it should work
 instance Functor f => Monad (Free f) where return = Var (Var x) >>= g = g x (Node x) >>= g = Node $ (fmap.(flip (>>=))) g x 
 but I have also tried implementation from this stackoverflow answer and got same error in ghci.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As an early adopter in Cardano, I was blessed to have decent bags as dapps get ready to launch. I'm no whale, more like jellyfish, but I still feel blessed.
 So this Christmas in recognition of dapps launching next year, I've decided to send all my personal friends who don't own Cardano or Crypto a ledger nano and 50 free ADA. Not promising them some get rich scheme, but giving free access to play and learn in the easiest project for introduction to the space.
 This is something I considered before, but it was always too complicated. Trying to explain to someone who doesn't feel they have the time what are gas fee's, polygon vs Ethereum networks, why so many different wallets, etc, etc was wayyy too complicated. Don't get me wrong, in true ape fashion, I jumped in and blew money playing around and made some gains in areas too. However, I could not expect that from friends or family. Cardano's native asset management through a single wallet address, security of the hard fork combinator with upgrades, and the coming dapp wave has finally pushed me to do this on a project in the blockchain space. Having them imagine that instead of a jpeg of nothingness, imagine that's just one of many health records or property housing deeds, credit worthiness or any other data we currently give to tens to hundreds of companies to store and expose to hacks.
 Anyways, thought it was a good idea for adoption, and wanted to share in case any other fortunate community members wanted to share their ideas and help push adoption through free, understandable introductions.
 Have a wonderful holiday season community, here's to 2022 🍻🍻🥂

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a program in Emacs Lisp that turns a decimal number into a base-256 number. The numbers involved are very large, so here's the logic of it, where base256 is an array of unicode characters, myNum is a number in the septenseptuagintacentillions, and output is an output variable initially set to nil:
  (while (>= myNum 1) (setq output (concat output (aref base256 (mod myNum 256)))) (setq myNum (truncate (/ myNum 256)))) 
 I want to rewrite it in Haskell, but I'm having some trouble. Obviously, I can't use the same logic in Haskell, so here is what I have so far: ``` -- Builds an array of integers by taking the modulus of each iteration of dividing a number by 256 buildNum num = [mod x 256 | x <- (iterate trunkDiv num)] where trunkDiv l = truncate $ div l 256
 -- Create an array by accessing the item in my array of symbols that corresponds to a number in an array of integers mapNum nums syms = [syms !! y | y <- nums]
 main :: IO () main = do putStrLn $ mapNum (buildNum myNum) base256 ``` Now, as far as I can tell, what I need is to stop iterating when the truncated product of my number and 256 reaches 1, but I don't know where to even begin looking for that information.
 Could anybody give me some pointers on getting this to work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just stumbled upon this article and I thought I'd give you a quick overview of why I'm really pumped for what's arriving next month.
 ​
 DeFi Ecosystem on Cardano
 DeFi requires you to have --> A web wallet (NAMI, YOROI, etc) which will let you:
  
Make swaps / Provide liquidity on DEXes (SundaeSwap)
 Use leveraged instruments and synthetic assets (Indigoprotocol)
 Optimize your yield farming (Geniusyield)
 Trade NFTs (Cnft)
  
Turns out we have all that... It's all ready to be unleashed, once the PAB is released by Jan 2022.
 I personally made good ROI during the DeFi season in 2020 by aping in DEXes. Seems to have a very good R / R overall. I'm targetting SundaeSwap + Cardashift incubated DEX. NFA
 The days of Cardano being poked for having little to show for, is now undeniably coming to an end. I know where my money will be next year anon. Do you ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Renovate is used widely to help manage dependencies. Since this week was a short week for us at Caribou, two of us spent some time starting the work to add Haskell support https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/pull/13224. It needs help.
 If anyone is inclined to pick up where we left off, or start a brand new branch using some or all of what we did, please do! Please communicate your intent on the PR itself so if there are others who want to also work on it, you don't have to duplicate their work.
 There's another new tool in this same space, Stack Lint Extra Deps. The maintainer was kind enough to get on a phone call with us on Monday to discuss pros and cons of working on SLED vs Renovate, and the consensus is we'd all like to see Renovate support Haskell first. But Renovate is written in TypeScript and SLED is written in Haskell so if you'd like to help but don't like/know TypeScript, SLED is a good candidate to hack on :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In one of his videos on his YouTube channel, Charles Hoskinson once talked about a conversation he had with one of the creators of the internet. CH was basically reflecting upon the regrets the man expressed over designed decisions that had been made that were horrible and that have led to creating an internet with many vulnerabilities... and how he wanted things to be different for Cardano. 
 CH then reiterated his commitment to ensuring that Cardano become a massive financial system that had to be built rightly from the start, so that when it is all said and done, he would feel differently about Cardano than what that man did about the internet. (The internet is to big now to make major changes to some of the past design decisions). CH doesn’t approve of the “move fast, break things” culture of the software culture. Ethereum, for example, is still figuring out how to deal with some of their past poor design decisions, just like that internet founder.
 Which brings me to this interview I’ve been watching where the Charli3 team through their communication with IOHK had their code audited by a very reputable company. This allowed Charli3 to find issues early in their codebase. And even though none of the issues were devastating, they were important enough to merit revisions. CH is also intent on the creation of certification programs to give Dapps the option to vet their code to ensure a minimum standard of quality and safety. 
 This may seem inconsequential now as Cardano’s ecosystem is still in the early days of its growth, but this is going to bring massive changes to the Dapp ecosystem in crypto in the long-run. And the quality of the Dapps on Cardano at launch will be high and likelihood of security flaws will be reduced significantly. This is going to be a huge game changer for the crypto space, and will be a major selling point for adoption and trust from users and businesses alike.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a little bit of understanding about the ERC20 Converter... I know it locks up the tokens on Etherium and creates a Cardano equivalent that can be used or traded. But what happens if someone wants to cash out back to fiat. Do they need to convert back to the Etherium network and then sell? What happens to the locked value on the Etherium network? Of course if they want to cash out they can convert the "Etherium" token to Ada and cash out, but my question still stands as above.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You may think the title is misleading, it's not. 
 What I mean by relatives is that these two cryptocurrencies are derived from the same parent document. This document is cited at the bottom of Bitcoin's Whitepaper and is linked here: http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt. Anyone is free to read the document (it's fairly short) but I will leave my own observations below.
 The document is broken in two demonstrations for methods to create "crypto-anarchy" or a government free currency. 
 The first protocol describes Bitcoin with some prehistoric modifications: 
  
Creation of money via solving a previously unsolved computational problem.
 Transfer of money via broadcasting the transaction to everyone on the blockchain.
  
There is more general cryptocurrency ideas I'm choosing to skip over.
 This all makes sense considering the document is cited in Bitcoin's wallpaper. But, then the author offers another protocol. 
  
Using "servers" linked by a Usenet-style broadcast channel instead of peer-to-peer. 
 I believe these resemble ADA's Staking Pools
 
 The servers agree on the amount of money (ADA) to be created during each period (Epoch).
  
This post is nothing more than an observation I had while I was reading this document. Or maybe it was an applause to this author (who is unnamed) for his imagination and accuracy in 1998. With all this said, I stand with my statement that Cardano and Bitcoin are, in fact, relatives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm Jeff, a long time member of the community. My days go back to a Cardano meeting with Sebastien at the Microsoft building in Seattle...2018.
 We are excited to announce a new project and are looking for team members to fill specific roles. 
 The project is focused around auctions for CNFT. We have a dynamite domain, web template and promotional talent onboard. There will be an evolution to support stakepools which will be announced at a later date. Very exciting
 We will also have a charity auction with more details to come. Community will vote where per auction. 
 All sales will have a portion dedicated to a lump sum to be awarded by the community chosen beneficiary. Lots of fun.
 The immediate opportunities:
 ✔️ Experience with HTML to edit and do updates to the site.
 ✔️Cardano smart contract dev
 ✔️Telegram, Twitter and other community interaction platform representative/ambassador
 Please message me if you are interested. Some folks have offered up front, but we wanted to share our opportunity to the community here. We will share in work and celebrate the $uccess together.
 Thank you and Happy Holiday! 
 Cheers,
 Jeff

 I thought about using DataKinds and KindSignatures to set if the Item can be used in trades and i thought about putting the class of a mage like if he is a Mage as a Phantom type. I dunno if it's a dumb but i want to learn creative ways to enforce some properties.
 What are the cool mechanics that u can enforce using types in Haskell? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, i just started to be a good citizen and write some regression tests for my code.
 Considering i have some error-type and a function that might result in an error:
 ```haskell newtype Username = Username{unUsername::Text} data UsernameError = ErrorNameLength | ErrorNameIllegalCharacter
 -- smart constructor for username newUsername :: Text -> Either LoginError Username newUsername name = ... -- inspects argument and might return Left ```
 in my HUnit test, how would I assert that e.g. newUsername with "" results in ErrorNameLength?
 My thoughts is to do it with pattern matching in do notation, relying on the MonadFail instance of IO. While this works, i see that HUnits assertion-functions allow to provide a descriptive error message in case of failure.
 Therefore I am questioning wether this would be the correct way.

 Thank you, we really appreciate your input and let us know if you have any specific questions in the comments. This is just the beginning of the KYC conversation on Cardano, and specifically how can we bank the unbanked AND abide to regulatory changes that are coming to the crypto world. 
 Here's the form link, thank you very much and stay awesome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm seeing so many fud posts of people complaing about daedalus performance.
 Of course the correct answer is that if they are not a cryptoanarchist willing to sacrifice their computer performance for helping the health of the ecosystem and bickering about it instead, theay should jsut use a light wallet like a normal mainstream person. We will still probably have more than enough full nodes running around the world from people willuing to do that, so we don't need everyone to do it.
 So even if recommending Daedalus to everyone might seem like a good idea helping the health of the network, it might be doing more damage than help in the adoption and make people who don't realize the difference between light and full nodes hate Cardano. The light wallets exist for a reason. They might think this is the issie only with it because other blockchains are already past the point of recommending full nodes as the first options to everyone. Heck, most people have theirt bitcoin in custody already I think.
 So let's stop putting Daedalus as the first recommended wallet, we should still mention it, but warn about it's consequences and inform what using it means together with such recommendation. But for some reason, most tutorials for newbies on how to use Cardano only recommend Daedalus with no warnings or explanations. That's just hurtful...
 There's already enough fud as it is, we don't need to shoot ourselves in the foot giving them even more ammo like this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UPDATE: this appears to be a general issue with counting transactions of an address. Not exactly sure which page counts what exactly still but it seems to be general for cardano addresses. It might be the difference of whether an address only counts outcoming vs. incoming and outcoming transactions. But I'd have to confirm this first. We should also think about what this implies when comparing contract volumes... 
 We have seen a stark rise in Smart Contract usage recently and I was curious how many transactions the most used Smart Contract so far had.
 I found MusliSwap, reporting that they had crossed 50k interactions recently on twitter:https://twitter.com/MuesliSwapTeam/status/1472740442999595014
 This seems reasonable, as only recently they were confirmed to be far ahead with only 30k interactions.
 Now I checked cardanoscan, the address they gave and can confirm that at the time of writing it is already beyond 50k (at 59k)https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1wy2mjh76em44qurn5x73nzqrxua7ataasftql0u2h6g88lc3gtgpz
 I wanted to cross-check and went to adapools...https://adapools.org/address/addr1wy2mjh76em44qurn5x73nzqrxua7ataasftql0u2h6g88lc3gtgpz
 They have already 74k transactions there. So they certainly crossed 50k and seem to have taken the minimum of both counts, which is very cool to see (a dApp truly coming to live!)
 But what still grinds my gears: How can this huge margin occur? Do the websites count differently? What could make the difference in the way they count?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Initially i was suggested to write haskell code in Latex by Minted Package. But when i am compiling this code
 ```\documentclass[12pt]{article}
 \usepackage{minted} \begin{document} \begin{minted}{haskell} --type Stack a = [a] --push :: Stack a -> a -> Stack a --push xs x = x:xs
 --pop :: Stack a -> (a, Stack a) --pop [] = error "Empty List" --pop (x:xs) = (x, xs)

 push :: Stack a -> a -> Stack a push (Stack xs) x = Stack (x:xs)
 pop :: Stack a -> (a,Stack a) pop (Stack xs) | null xs = error "Empty List" | otherwise = (head xs, Stack xs)
 \end{minted} \end{document} ```
 It was showing the error
 ``` line 3: Package minted Error: You must invoke LaTeX with the -shell-escape flag. \begin
 line 3: Emergency stop. \begin{document}
  : shell escape is disabled, so I can only detect \ifwindows. 
 ```
 Why it is happening and how to overcome it ?

On other blockchains the spotlight is often stolen by existing giants, and in ethereum's case, L2s, whereas we here are keen to see what devs can come up with (anything that can give us the edge). Would like put some of those staked ada rewards to use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my continued attempt to get mstksg's AOC template working, I temporarily gave up on my MacOS attempt (thanks again /u/simonmic for the help so far!) and switched to my Linux box. After a long failure trying to use apt-get install haskell-platform and getting unfixable (by me) dependency errors, I switched to using ghcup (why do we even have haskell-platform if it's not going to work?), and things seem to be compiling and running.
 But now I have some (hopefully basic) questions. - The "Interactive" section of the documentation says I should be able to import an AOC.Run.Interactive package. I do not see how to do this. Where / how do I run ghci to import this? I can see the Haskell file in src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs, but import AOC.Run.Interactive fails with ghci run in either the top level or down in src. If I :l src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs I get Illegal lambda-case (use LambdaCase), but I didn't think that was the right thing in the first place. I assume I'm missing something simple and obvious here? - The "Executable" section of the documentation says I should be able to get a plain old runnable executable aoc-dev. How do I get this? Right now I'm using cabal run aoc-dev run 1 a for instance. (If I do build an executable, do I need to rebuild it when I change a day's solution?)
 As always any help is most appreciated.

Flakes
Flakes are a new format to package Nix-based projects in a more
discoverable, composable, consistent and reproducible way. A flake is
just a repository or tarball containing a file named flake.nix that
specifies dependencies on other flakes and returns any Nix assets such
as packages, Nixpkgs overlays, NixOS modules or CI tests.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twice a year — in May and November, nixpkgs maintainers and
contributors get together to fix as many build failures as possible
for the new release. The event is, as per tradition, called Zero Hydra
Failures, or ZHF for short.
This year, me and fellow hacker cab404
had organized a hackathon to help the cause and spread the Nix love
around. The basic premise was, quoting cab404:
Go—go—go!
We wanted to fix as many builds as possible, right before the
branchoff. Fixing the broken builds would allow NixOS 21.11 to have a more complete package
set.
The main point of this post is to share the experience with people
looking to organize similar events.

Preparation
Due to the current lockdown in Moscow, we
weren’t able to decide whether the hackathon would happen at all until
about a week before t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Type-checking plugins interface directly with GHC’s constraint solver. This means we need to have
a certain level of familiarity with how GHC generates, manipulates and solves constraints.
In this post, we will attempt to demystify this constraint solving process, as well as review
a few aspects of type-family reduction, to facilitate the development of type-checking plugins.
This post will serve as a reference, when we start writing our own type-checking plugins in Part III.
Don’t worry: you don’t need to know everything before you start writing your own plugins!
It’s only when debugging a type-checking plugin that the rubber hits the road:
a few skills become rather important, such as the ability to understand the different types of constraints,
to read Core (and, in particular, coercion…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although the feature is still marked as experimental, the release of Nix 2.4 marks the entry of content-addressed derivations in a released Nix version.
This is something to celebrate, but also an occasion to look back and see what this addition means, implementation wise.
This new feature required indeed some deep changes both in the high-level algorithm describing the build loop (and also as a consequence in its low-level details) as well as in the “plumbing” code around it.
Note: Because it touches the implementation, this post will be more technical than the others, and will also assume that you’re somewhat familiar with what content-addressed derivations means, and how it works. If you haven’t done it already, I invite you to read the previous blog articles on the topic (1, 2 and 3), …]]></summary>
