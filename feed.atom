        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys I am new to the Cardano blockchain but like where it is going. ETH gas fees are insane and it is killing trade so I want to avoid ETH at all costs.
 I am looking to start my own private DEX but I can't seem to find any open source scripts to do so. There are many for ethereum such as (0x launch kit) and switchdex are there any available for Cardano?
 I want to create some native tokens and allow them to be swapped via my own DEX to help fund my new business projects.
 Any advice or links to open source dex scripts would be much appreciated.

 For the Most Anticipated Trend section of the podcast, at 1:04:20 , Chamath is asked for his pick , and he responds the following :
 "Peer to peer payments, the destruction of traditional rails, it will come out of Africa."
 Is he hinting Cardano's efforts? Paired with Starlink efforts and successes? Or is there something else in the works he is basing his prediction on?

I pull up, and I’m forced to look upwards– inferiorly–into their pretty, over-caffeinated eyes. And what do they give me? A look of expectation, a look of want. We both know what’s happening. A transaction is about to occur, and I’m on the short end. $3.11 for a “venti” Americano–oh yeah, my cheeks are being clapped here.
 Then comes the best part: they demand that cash. “Three eleven.” I love it when it comes out bluntly, like they’re annoyed they even had to ask. Don’t hit me with the pleasantries, no ma’m. Peer at me and simply make your decree. Shoot daggers into me from above that mask. What am I going to do about it from all the way down here?
 I have no choice but to comply. And I mean none! I am legally obligated to hand it over. I look up with my wide deep blues, and meekly hold out my card in my final act of submission. Please, take it. Deplete my bank account. Take everything I’ve ever worked for. 
 They hand me a cup of hot dirty water, and I drive away with a dumb, wry smile. Everyone wins. I mean, I’ve lost for sure. But really, I won.

Cryptoviser has been complaning about Cardano not burning coins almost daily in his YouTube videos.

So instead of using google, is someone working on a cardano search engine for goods and services or is this something IOG is working?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y'all :) 
 I have been slightly out of the Cardano loop these past few months and wondered if there were any good places to find development teams working on projects. I'm starting to get some traction on my test engineering consultancy and looking for clients in the blockchain space, however not sure where to start looking at the moment! 
 I'm planning to offer three services: test strategies and planning, test automation, and a combination of the both. While I have a pretty solid engineering background this business side is very new to me so I'd appreciate any advice/support from you! 
 The reason I'm focusing on the Cardano ecosystem is 1. I love Cardano, 2. I was in the Plutus Pioneer cohort so know smart contracts, and 3. worked on Cardano for ~16 months :)

 Edit: thanks for all the replies. I'm going to try out Nami, and see how that goes. I used it for the SS test, and it seemed alright.

Maybe satisfies the type equation FX = 1 + X, where the functor F takes a set to a point plus that set.
  
It sounds brilliant, but I don't know what any of that means. (I have only a beginner's understanding of what a functor is.) Where can I start learning?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the year is coming to an end, I decided now would be a good time to clean up all exchanges that I don't plan on using in 2022. While cleaning up my Kraken account I decided to convert everything to ADA and send it to one of my wallets. For some reason, after copying/pasting my wallet address and going through the confirmation on Kraken, it sent it to a different address and I ultimately just "burned" ~63 ADA. 
 I'm not sure why or how this happened, I even looked at all of my past addresses and none of them matched the one that I just sent my ADA to. Oh well. Never thought I'd have to learn this lesson the hard way. 
 Luckily this wasn't a significant amount of ADA and I'm only out ~$90, which is a good chunk of change, but it won't change/ruin my life. Just wanted to remind everyone to be careful out there, cheers to a new year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The incentive structure of Cardano is absolutely beautiful, and I have yet to see a more sustainable AND rewarding structure out there in my opinion. That said, since there is no lockup period for staking (I wouldn't stake if there was, or if it wasn't self-custody), how relevant is that %staked number if that 70+% can theoretically change drastically in an instant?
 I know we haven't seen this happen yet, likely due to the incentives themselves working well, but I'm just curious other people's thoughts.
 Did I just talk myself into a full circle and answer my own question? idk...thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just watched this video from Charles on YouTube about why Cardano is more decentralized than bitcoin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvgGNumbXxQ&t=184s
 The summary basically is this:
  
Cardano has a higher number of validating nodes
 Cardano has a higher number of consensus participants
 Cardano has a more defined mechanism to handle source management and decisions to fork
  
I am curious about what he means by this though. 
 For #1: By "validating nodes" is that analogous to bitcoin miners? Are there really fewer people mining bitcoin than are staking cardano?
 For #2: what does he mean by "consensus participant"? Is that like a full node operator? I find it hard to believe more people are running cardano full nodes than bitcoin full nodes. How fast does the cardano blockchain grow in size? Since it is so fast and feature-rich, will cardano blockchain remain small enough for plebs to run it in their homes?
 For #3, what does he mean? Does he mean because of governance tokens? So source code changes can be hired out by the treasury and fork decisions can be voted on? Is the "whoever stakes the most decides" mechanism really more decentralized than "every individual full node operator can make their own decision to signal for a fork"?

 Any thoughts on what the surprise could be? Taking the charts emojis I am deeply hoping they finally put out charts and analytics for the tokens being traded!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Charles Hoskinson has revealed Cardano's plans for 2022. In a 30-minute Christmas Eve chat on YouTube, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson reflected on the current state of the industry and the Cardano network. Some plans for the project for next year were also made. Hoskinson said the following: “There was a tweet from 2020 where I said, 'I predict we'll have thousands of dApps and hundreds of Assests on Cardano by next year.' I'm wrong both ways.” According to him, instead of hundreds, more than two million assets have now been issued on the Cardano network. The majority are reportedly NFTs. As for the expansion of decentralized applications (dApps) on the network, however, Hoskinson said, "we have yet to see significant traction there." He claimed that this was due to the delayed release of the Goguen update. The release introduced smart contracts to the network. Right now i am bullish on a few projects like: Rise up, ATRI, PKT and Spores. Im very glad I've found them. DYOR!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody,
 I wanted to reach out to the reddit community about haskell salaries. The only other reddit thread on the topic I could find was from 8 years ago, so I was curious if things have changed in the past 8 years.
 According to the Stack Overflow 2021 Developer Survey, Haskell developers seem to make much less than some other "functional" languages (i.e. Clojure, F#, Elixir). Do you find this to be true in your experience?
 I'd also be interested to hear about haskell salaries in the US vs elsewhere.
 If you would like, feel free to share your salary here (for others to reference), but no pressure!
 Thanks in advance!

 I hope all is well and everyone had a great holiday season. I am having an issue minting NFT's from the CLI they appear to be minting without metadata, even though I am referring to the fully populated metadata.json file used. All variables are correct ($variables are correct) Can anyone toss me a bone at what I'm doing wrong? The NFT does actually mint, just minus all metadata and thus no picture or details about the NFT.
 My Minting Command =
 cardano-cli transaction build \ --mainnet \ --alonzo-era \ --tx-in $txhash#$txix \ --tx-out $nftwallet+$output+"$tokenamount $policyid.$tokenname" \ --change-address $address \ --mint="$tokenamount $policyid.$tokenname" \ --minting-script-file $script \ --metadata-json-file metadata.json \ --invalid-hereafter $slotnumber \ --witness-override 2 \ --out-file matx.raw 
 Metadata file -
 { "721": { "HIDDEN": { "HIDDEN": { "name": "NFT NAME HERE", "image": "ipfs://IPFSLINKHERE", "mediaType": "image/png", "description": "DESCRIPTION HERE", "files": [ { "name": "PIC NAME HERE", "mediaType": "image/png", "src": "ipfs://IPFS LINK HERE" } ] } }, "version": "1.0" } }

I think that there will be some amazing opportunities in the next little while with some of the projects launching on Cardano. Being new to trading etc, I swapped ADA for some WMT on muesliswap right before it launched on the three CEX’S only to see the price plummet. I do not want that to happen again so I am wondering where to find the information required to learn how to deal with new token launches. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello smart people,
 We're wanting to do something innovative in education, an NFT version of ePortfolio. Meaning that a submission (i.e. for credit) would comprise some images (at least three, all unique) and text files (at least two); all of these files would be related and best displayed together. Ideally it'd be the public could see and buy one public-facing image, which would be associated with four or five other files. 
 The real-world analogy is a portfolio; you're an assessor and someone hands you a binder of work the student has done and needs to be evaluated on. You need to see every page in the binder, and there also needs to be a way for you to acknowledge your read it and sign it off. We're assuming it'd involve NFT but that may even be wrong, or more likely not the whole story. I.e. there are ePortfolio softwares out there, could they be linked to Cardano?
 I understand typically when creating an NFT, you enter the ipfs ID number of the (jpg) file into a field, but that's only linking the one jpg.
 Could anyone suggest how we might go about setting this all up? My mind is boggling at the creative possibilities; unfortunately my knowledge and skill in all these parts lags far behind. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://thma.github.io/posts/2021-12-27-Implementing-a-functional-language-with-Graph-Reduction.html
 I've just published a new Blog Post on a classic implementation technique for lazy functional programming: combinatory logic based graph-reduction engine.
 The implementation is structured into three parts:
  
A λ-calculus parser from A Combinatory Compiler which was extended to cover a tiny functional language based on the untyped λ-calculus.
 A compiler from λ-calculus to combinatory logic combinators (S,K,I,B,C and Y) which is based on bracket-abstraction and some optimization rules.
 A graph-reducer. Combinator terms are allocated into a graph data-structure. Which is then reduced by applying combinator graph-reduction. The destructive inplace reduction of the graph is made possible by using STRef
 mutable references.

        <id>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29705957</id>
        <link href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29705957"/>
        <updated>2021-12-27T19:36:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
I've just had a bizarre thing happen and wanted to see if the HN community could come up with some theories as to what happened.
LastPass blocked a login attempt from Brazil (it wasn't me). According to an email I received from LastPass, this login was using the LastPass account's master password. The email doesn't look like it's a phishing attempt.
What troubles me is that the master password was stored in a local encrypted KeePassX file.
I can imagine that someone has my KeePassX file and the (completely different) password to this file. If that's the case, I'm in a world of hurt.
But are there any other possibilities? Is the email from LastPass accurate i.e. was the login attempt actually using my master password? Is there some LastPass extension installed on some computer still having a valid auth token allowing them to login as me to LastPass..?
I'm really confused, and scared.
Thanks for your help.
P.S. The LastPass account had 2FA set up, but I was able to simply remove it (since I didn't have access to the token anymore). That's scary too -- what's the point of a 2FA you can remove...??
---
Update:
- the email was truly not phishing -- the same information regarding the login attempt appears in my LastPass dashboard. I also talked to LastPass support over the phone, and they confirmed seeing the same information.
- There are 2 separate users in the thread below confirming that the same exact same thing happened to them, from the exact same IP range as me.
Either the 3 of us had the same malware/Chrome extension or somehow had our master passwords compromised...? Or...? Is this a LastPass issue?

 What we're looking for
 I co-own an NFT project called Cardano Forms. We're looking to put out a new series and need a back end developer who can set up an on-demand minting system for it. This position can be temporary or permanent.
 Payment
 As this series is a non-profit, payment would be in ADA rather than % of the series.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, as a means to learn Haskell I've decided to write a very basic Web3 implementation in it, everything has been great so far but I'm having a really hard time trying to encode integers that are greater than 8 bytes because of the data types. I've come across some useful libraries but settled on using Data.Binary. Here's an example of something I want to do in Elixir:
 ```elixir
 This just gives you a 32 bytes representation of that number
 <<3214000000000000000000::signed-256>>
  
<<0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 174, 59,
  
53, 195, 127, 137, 120, 0, 0>>
 ```
 On Haskell I've tried and it works with smaller numbers (Whatever fits into Int64), but with bigger ones:
 ```haskell
 B64.encode $ BL.toStrict $ runPut $ putInt64be 3214000000000000000000
 <interactive>:61:48: warning: [-Woverflowed-literals]
 Literal 3214000000000000000000 is out of the Int range -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807
 "AAB4iX/DNTs="
 ```
 Which does not give me the correct representation since the value is out of bounds (I think the number it sticks with is 4266531174538018816 (maxBound :: Int64) rather than the one I passed)
 ​
 So, I wanted to ask, what are my options to encode these numbers in the same way I can do on the first Elixir example? Is there a technique I'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know what I was thinking about last night, as much as I have given my friends shit about their specific choosing of the cryptocurrencies that they desire and want to see adopted. At the end of the day, the philosophy and theory behind crypto in and of itself and all the change that inevitably will come with it, is something we can all definitely agree on. 
 Just reiterating that its important to remember that we are all on the same side as far as changing how we want to live on a day to day basis and the hope that it will have a big enough impact on changing the power dynamic from the wealthy to the poor, which, we all know currently exists within our micro and macro economic societies. 
 We must keep telling ourselves that this is for the good of the world and we must remind ourselves that we are in this together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During last five years it was twice that I had to figure out how parse JSON in streaming fashion. I figured that I release a library, so I don't have to figure it out again some years in the future. I suspect this library might be useful to others too, since it is likely that I am not the only who ran into such problem. In my particular situation use cases were:
  
Parse a very large JSON file, contents of which was one very big top level dictionary with millions of key value pairs. My requirement was that I needed to modify each individual key/value pair without affecting memory overheaad.
 Continuously parse an infinite stream of log entries from a service called logentries.com where each entry was formatted as JSON and delimited by a newline.
  
conduit-aeson is capable of handling both of these use cases and probably others as well. See haddock for examples and documentation. Here is one such example:
 ```
  
  
:set -XOverloadedStrings :set -XTypeApplications import Conduit let input = "{ \"foo\": 1, \"bar\": 2, \"baz\": 3 }" runConduit $ yield input .| conduitObject @String @Int .| printC ("foo",1) ("bar",2) ("baz",3) ```

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fyi before I continue, ada is my biggest bag I hold and will hold for many years to come.
 Recently got into staking on Daedalus, it is very easy to do and I recommend anyone who hasn't done so to do it.
 But the sync times to the block chain are ridiculous. Took me 2+ days for the initial sync to complete and now every consecutive sync of roughly 0.5% is taking hours.
 Why the hell is this so slow? Anyone else experiencing this? Cheers.
 Edit: Also I forgot to add the blue screen of death has been appearing on my laptop occasionally since installing the wallet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Djed is a protocol for crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoins (link to iohk paper about Djed). While an implementation of Djed doesn't rely on any official issuer, what is the significance of COTI? 
 Djed can be a perfectly well functioning stablecoin on Cardano without COTI. The SigUSD stablecoin (an implementation of Djed - discussed in the Djed paper) on Ergo blockchain has been around for a while and is listed on the ErgoDEX and doesn't seem to need any official entity to "issue" it. The same should work for Cardano.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using this proposal (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0025/README.md) it's not explicit about what type of URIs should be supported in the AssetToken's image property. And, I don't think it should be explicit - any valid URI should be supported. However, most, if not all, NFT explorers (e.g. pool.pm, cardano-tools.io, adatools.io) expect the image value to be IPFS. And, even if it's a valid URI - but not an IPFS one - they all fail to show the image. I can literally an empty pixel URI and it will break (
 { "721": { "policy-id": { "MyBlankPixelToken": { "name": "MyBlankPixelToken", "image": "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" } } } } 
 To "get around this" I've noticed that these NFT explorers will respect any valid URI in the files[].src
 Is this expected? What do you all think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of weeks ago Nix 2.4 was
released. This
was the first release in more than two years. More than 195
individuals contributed to this release. Since Tweag is the biggest
contributor to the Nix project, I’d like to highlight some of the
features that Tweag has worked on.

Flakes
Flakes are a new format to package Nix-based projects in a more
discoverable, composable, consistent and reproducible way. A flake is
just a repository or tarball containing a file named flake.nix that
specifies dependencies on other flakes and returns any Nix assets such
as packages, Nixpkgs overlays, NixOS modules or CI tests.
You can read more about flakes in the following blog posts:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Twice a year — in May and November, nixpkgs maintainers and
contributors get together to fix as many build failures as possible
for the new release. The event is, as per tradition, called Zero Hydra
Failures, or ZHF for short.
This year, me and fellow hacker cab404
had organized a hackathon to help the cause and spread the Nix love
around. The basic premise was, quoting cab404:
Go—go—go!
We wanted to fix as many builds as possible, right before the
branchoff. Fixing the broken builds would allow NixOS 21.11 to have a more complete package
set.
The main point of this post is to share the experience with people
looking to organize similar events.

Preparation
Due to the current lockdown in Moscow, we
weren’t able to decide whether the hackathon would happen at all until

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Type-checking plugins interface directly with GHC’s constraint solver. This means we need to have
a certain level of familiarity with how GHC generates, manipulates and solves constraints.
In this post, we will attempt to demystify this constraint solving process, as well as review
a few aspects of type-family reduction, to facilitate the development of type-checking plugins.
This post will serve as a reference, when we start writing our own type-checking plugins in Part III.
Don’t worry: you don’t need to know everything before you start writing your own plugins!
It’s only when debugging a type-checking plugin that the rubber hits the road:
a few skills become rather important, such as the ability to understand the different types of constraints,

This is something to celebrate, but also an occasion to look back and see what this addition means, implementation wise.
This new feature required indeed some deep changes both in the high-level algorithm describing the build loop (and also as a consequence in its low-level details) as well as in the “plumbing” code around it.
Note: Because it touches the implementation, this post will be more technical than the others, and will also assume that you’re somewhat familiar with what content-addressed derivations means, and how it works. If you haven’t done it already, I invite you to read the previous blog articles on the topic (1, 2 and 3), …]]></summary>
