                    <span>So i have been into crypto for about a year now, but still i don&#x27;t understand half of the things people are speaking about. Im not super smart but not dumb to so idk if its just me or not :p
 I understand the basics on how crypto works proof of work/proof of stake/blockchain technology but when it comes to dapps and defi etc im just kinda lost. I try to understand it but its difficult.
 do any of you guys know a good guide or book or pdf where everything is explained step by step so i can get deeper into crypto?
 Thanks for the read!

                    <span>This is a blog post from Ergo about what Taproot means for ERGO. Because Ergo and Cardano (along with other members of the UTxO Alliance like CKB) share the eUTxO model, all of this is equally applicable to Cardano.
 The key takeaway:
 &quot;The addition of BIP340 and zero-knowledge proofs for Bitcoin enables interoperability between Ergo [and Cardano] and Bitcoin, allowing for private cross-chain atomic swaps and potentially sidechaining in the future. &quot;
 Cardano + Bitcoin.
 This is bullish.

                    <span>As the title says. I couldn’t find this information easily anywhere.
 My SSD space is limited, so I need to delete it.
 Also, is there a way of changing the default location to an external hard drive?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit:
 Found this article with the blockchain location info both of mac and windows:

                    <span>I&#x27;m not going to lie. When I first got into Cardano I did not understand Blockchain tech or my country&#x27;s monetary system. After months of research. I think I can hold my own in a pretty extensive discussion about Cardano and where I see this ecosystem going. I&#x27;m extremely excited about the tech and partnerships on Cardano but there is one part of all this that I just don&#x27;t understand the hype. Non - fungible tokens particularly. I was never a collector of art, I never collected anything to be honest, but I found myself towards the beginning of my crypto journey obsessing over non- fungible token projects. I would skim the Cardano Kidz website and get excited about each series that was coming out. Then when it was time. I would choke. I just couldn&#x27;t do it. I couldn&#x27;t spend my hard earned money on a picture. I couldn&#x27;t justify it, to myself or my wife. I thought to myself... Why was I so excited in the first place? I don&#x27;t collect things? I&#x27;ve never collected shit in my life. What made me so excited about this art? Well as I thought about it, I&#x27;ve come to a conclusion. The truth is I don&#x27;t understand the hype. I was more excited about the tech behind non- fungible tokens then I was about the actual picture. I see the value in its verifiability and how revolutionary that verifiability is. But I&#x27;m not an art collector. I never was, and I felt kinda stupid for acting like I cared to be one. I&#x27;m happy people are using the Cardano blockchain, but I realized something today. 
 I just don&#x27;t care as much as I thought I did about these current Non fungible tokens.

                    <span>Are there any filecoin or similar projects being built on cardano? If so what are they?
 I’m still trying to learn about web3 so if this is redundant or something my apologies

 The intro I wrote teacher said it was too confusing as she has no idea what crypto is nor has she heard of it and I may have got carried away from the basic

                    <span>Hi, when I was looking for my staking address I found this post saying that there is no point using multiple addresses because your staking address can be determined from a single receiving address and a history of all your transactions derived from that.
 Is this true?
 I love Cardano but it seems to me like a pretty big privacy flaw that needs addressed if it is true

                    <span>I am using Koinly to generate a tax report. Everything has gone effortlessly until I had to add my Cardano wallet information.
 You have three choices for the app to track your transactions: 
 1) upload csv for each wallet (and edit the document appropriately) 2) upload wallet addresses (for UTXO-based wallets this means every external and internal wallet you&#x27;ve ever used (very tedious, and Koinly has difficulty editing UTXO transactions, that&#x27;s why they recommend the following) 3) upload xPUB key and sync transactions
 3 is the easiest and most efficient. But when I use the key for my wallet that is provided on the yoroi chrome extension then the Koinly sync shows 0 transactions (it also shows 0 on cardanoscan). Which is incorrect. This has happened for all my wallets on yoroi.
 Does anyone know why this is happening?

                    <span>I installed Daedalus wallet a few months ago. But now I wanted to verify the SHA256 checksum. It is different then the one on this page: 
 Daedalus - Downloads (daedaluswallet.io) 
 But I receive all updates.
 Version 4.4.1#19369
 I&#x27;m pretty sure I downloaded it from the correct website in the past.

What all other details shall I be aware/careful with or pay attention to ? 4. How do I choose the right stake pool ? (Like the saturation and everything)

This issue is also being tracked here: https://forum.cardano.org/t/massive-scam-pool-group-uncovered/85194
 Starting with this epoch huge amount of undetected fake pools was created - all pools share same relay IPs as MELD4, hosted by cloud service Contabo in Dusseldorf. Most of these relays have weird unrelated domains like &quot;relayeverstake.cloud&quot; or &quot;relaystakepoolservice.site&quot; always privately registered to someone in Hanoi / Vietnam.

                    <span>Hey Everyone!
 Let&#x27;s go...
 Newly covered today: 
  
IOHK has dropped their new article on eUTxO dApp architecture. It explains in detail a design for an eUTxO order book. https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/16/architecting-dapps-on-the-eutxo-ledger/
 Apparently we saw over 1MM transactions in Epoch 302. https://twitter.com/ccvaultio/status/1460673461614006276
 Looks like Cardano is seeing a huge amount of on-chain activity. The crazy part is this is all pre-PAB. Just wait until dApps can actually launch! Unsurprisingly, some supporters of other chains were shocked to realize they didn’t understand the difference between exchange trading volume and actual blockchain use volume. https://twitter.com/cardano_daily/status/1460238659098005504 https://messari.io/screener/most-active-chains-DB0…</span>

 Really disappointed that the 5th largest cryptocurrency isn&#x27;t supported.
 Why has this not been implemented yet? Any updates on this? Who should I follow to hear any announcements?

                    <span>I work for a tiny company (7 developers) which offers a sophisticated financial model. Our core software was written 20 years ago in C, and our new development is in a proprietary scripting language. This scripting language was never really meant to be used so widely, and it&#x27;s becoming difficult/painful to maintain. I have gotten really into functional programming lately so I started thinking about it as a solution. Specifically, I want to slowly replace all this code in our proprietary language with code in an off-the-shelf, functional language. Enter Haskell: from all my research, it emerged as my favorite choice. Fundamentally, our model just does a bunch of math on many lists of numbers (to give more context: the big competitors to our model are Excel spreadsheets). Haskell seems well …</span>

Not a fucking clue. I&#x27;m pretty sure this chick has BPD even though she denies mental illnesses exist in women and it is all just a ~normal~ response to trauma.
 It&#x27;s just funny these people hate on normies and liberals for getting all their views from MSM, but they regurgitate anything online grifters tell them and completely reinvent themselves because they have no real sense of who they are offline.
 How do you deal with people like this?

                    <span>During my internship at Tweag, I worked on creating a
safe interface for the sparkle library under the excellent mentorship of Facundo
Domínguez. sparkle is a Haskell library that provides bindings for
Apache Spark using inline-java’s Java interop capabilities.
As such, this new safe interface accomplishes the same
thing that inline-java’s safe interface does; it helps to ensure safe
management of Java references at compile-time using linear types.
As discussed in this earlier post,
we need to be careful to free Java references provided by inline-java when they’re done
being used, and we also shouldn’t use them after they’ve been freed. Since sparkle
manipulates references to Java objects defined in the Spark Java library, any potential users
must take care to safely manage references when…</span>

                    <span>In other chain, I have to add asset to make sure the token will be able to get into my wallet. So far, I&#x27;ve only used Daedalus to accumulate my rewards, which are automatically claimed.
 I never trade NFT or receive any other tokens this community created a while back. 
 If my stake pool is gonna give Sundaeswap token as well, how will I receive it and in which part of the wallet will I see ut? What should I do to make sure it&#x27;s gonna be in my wallet? Do I need to add asset too?
 Thank you for the help.

                    <span>Hi, a pair of days ago got my first Cardano tokens. I used a Wallet called Metamask, where i could use my Trezor T. Recently, i read that you could get your cardano working for you by a method called &quot;staking&quot;.
 How can i &quot;stake&quot; my cardano thought Metamask? I cannot find anything related :(
 I was thinking about using another wallet, but metamask was the only available wallet i could use with Trezor T and Binance Smart Chain tokens like cardano. If you know another wallet where i can stake my cardano and works with Trezor T, please tell me.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I own an Engineering company, and we mainly do engineering reports of buildings, machines and other items where we determine the market value, remaining economic life of the assets, etc. Most of our clients are other businesses, auditing companies, government agencies and the like. Most of are reports are used to assist and justify decision making, such as accepting real estate as collateral for loans, if a machine should or not be replaced, to register the actual market value for accounting purposes, ect. I thought I could register our reports in the cardano blockchain to have more traceability, but I am sure there are other uses for the technology I am not seeing. Does anybody have any ideas?

 Could anyone explain that?

                    <span>I used to have 3k cardano and spent them as the downpayment to buying an investment property overseas. The transaction was faster than wire transfers which took another week for the money to come through and cheaper as well. I didn&#x27;t want to but had no choice and I still made quite a profit from the original purchase price.
 Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t go back in due to the price a couple of weeks ago but now again got 500 ADA or so during this sale.
 I invested in ETH based alt coins to try them and its just insane, the fees, the complexity, the fleecing by brokers due to not having an official wallet.
 I have come to the conclusion that my other alt coins are there mostly to make money while Cardano is the one I truly see being a real currency the way crypto was meant to be.

                    <span>I sent some ADA to KuCoin from AdaLite over 2 hours ago (roughly 300 confirmations by now) but KuCoin is still not showing it. 
 Clearly this is a problem with Kucoin. Even BTC transactions usually show up faster than this with KuCoin. 
 Do any of you have experience with depositing (or withdrawing) ADA with KuCoin, and is it usually this slow?

                    <span>As I understand it, current Ouroboros on Shelley uses Nakamoto consensus. Hydra will bring in fast finality but is it the newer BFT protocol? If not should we upgrade Ouroboros to BFT like we had with Byron?
 I’m not an expert on any of this , just been doing some reading in the last few days.

                    <span>My Daedalus wallet was acting up a bit so I installed Yoroi as a browser extension. After restoring the Daedalus wallet in Yoroi, I saw three columns:
  
Total ADA (e.g. 10), Total rewards (e.g. 01) , Total delegated ADA (e.g. 10).
  
&quot;Total rewards&quot; comes with a button to withdraw rewards into the total. I did it, and paid the fee for doing so.
 Now the Yoroi wallet balance reads: 
  
Total ADA e.g. 11, Total rewards 0 and total delegated ADA e.g. 11.
  
The problem is that switching back to Daedalus, all I see is Total ADA e.g. 11.
 In other words, according to Yoroi, my wallet&#x27;s rewards do not compound automatically: I have to pay a fee in order to add the earned rewards to my stake-pool-delegated principle.
 So... what&#x27;s going on? Which one of the two representations of the same wallet is true? The Daedalus one? Or the Yoroi one?
 Do rewards automatically compound in Daedalus?
 Or not?

                    <span>When we invest a new startup, one of the main factor is to look into the team behind the project.
 Astarter, which backed by Cardano stakeholders-Emurgo, to build Defi Hub on Cardano for user and developers.Emurgo provides socially impactful solutions through tech development &amp; investment.
 with support from Emurgo, Astarter is equipped with everything that is needed to meet the surging demand of startup in the Cardano system.
 Astarter consist of 4 core applications: 
 1.Launchpad
 2.Dex
 3.Lending &amp; Borrowing 
 4.Tech Service Platform
 According to the roadmap, Astarter will have it IDO in coming weeks and to launch its laundpad in Q1 2022 and the team published its weekly technical update, its seem on tracks. 
 I believe this project will be a huge launch to Cardano ecosystem as the ecosystem is still in very early stage compared to its huge user base.

 Let&#x27;s go...
 Newly covered today:
  
Seeing reports that Cardano’s 24 hour volume recently exceeded Ethereum! https://twitter.com/cardano_daily/status/1460238659098005504
 We’ve seen a very nice and steady rise in transactions over the last 15 days! https://twitter.com/WillyzPortico/status/1460221046112456704
 The January Haskell class in Ghana will include 80 students! https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1460259961313837058
  
Previously Covered but still interesting:
  
In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano. https://twitter.com/seal_kiman/status/1443593563846193155

                    <span>I saw this post on twitter, apparently they&#x27;ve developed an SDK that allows anyone to construct minting transactions offline using Javascript and CSL that can be submitted via blockfrost:
 https://twitter.com/lovadaart/status/1460322409446313992?s&#x3D;20
 This could be a game changer for developers like me who don&#x27;t want to run a node (I&#x27;ve tried using the docker containers, but in AWS the machine required to run my node costs hundreds of dollars a month!) I&#x27;ve also tried constructing these transactions manually using CSL and it&#x27;s not a trivial task. I&#x27;ve been waiting for something like this to come out and wanted to share so that they can get some more interest since I&#x27;d love to see this become a reality!

                    <span>One of the common complaints with the Haskell ecosystem is the existence of libraries with little expository documentation. Sometimes these libraries are quite useful and, in fact, are part of the mind space of the more seasoned members of the community. Yet, for a newcomer such libraries can seem impenetrable. Yet is all hope lost? The code is there after all. That’s the documentation, right!?
 What are your strategies for familiarizing yourself (to the point of pragmatic proficiency) with a sparsely documented library? 
 Do you have any stories or tales of a time when you achieved something “great” in such a case?

                    <span>For context: I’ve been using Haskell for about five years now, and loving it. I consider myself a relatively intermediate Haskeller, insofar as I understand and regularly use the more advanced parts of GHC. Though I rarely use it in production (as almost all my programming is for personal projects of interest), I find myself extremely productive in Haskell, and can generally get GHC to do what I want.
 Except when what I want is good performance. It’s not that I don’t know about laziness: I know what it is and (roughly) how it works, and I take advantage of it often enough. It’s not that I’m unaware of space leaks: if the profiler shows a great big triangle shape, or my program slows down as it runs, those are usually pretty good signs that I have one.

                    <span>I am on a sabbatical to reevaluate priorities in my life and decided to finally take a deep dive on the language after knowing about many years ago.
 It&#x27;s been a daily lesson on humility. For most other languages, one week of studies at the end of a work day plus the whole weekend would be enough to have a firm grasp of its fundamentals and make decent stuff. But with Haskell it&#x27;s been three weeks from monday to monady and it is kicking me hard on the butt, nuts, teeth and anyplace else that hurts. I think this is more related to the way I think as an imperative programmer (more than OO or even immutability) than being a difficult language. Maybe it is a difficult language. I don&#x27;t kow.
 I really liked the language. I like its simplicity and expressivity while not losing rigor with types. …</span>

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say I am working on multiple Haskell projects, some of them using cabal as the main build system, some of them using Stack, some of them are just libraries, some also have executables, and they don&#x27;t all always use the same version of GHC (that changes through time of course). Some of these projects are mine, some are not mine and I am contributing via a fork.
 What is the best way to maintain my tools/toolchain so that I can easily switch between the projects without too much hassle?
 Specifically, the things I find tricky is:
 - Ensuring I use the correct version of &#x60;stan&#x60;, since it needs to be compiled with the same version of GHC as the project.- Ensuring I use the correct version of &#x60;hls&#x60;, since it needs to be compiled with the same version of GHC as the project.

 As part of my DD, I like looking at the total value locked (TVL) for the blockchains.
 I am unable to find this information for Cardano? Anyone that could help me?

                    <span>So I have an idea in mind that I think would be interesting in terms of a wallet.
 Some of the issue with wallets is the trade off between security and usable funds.
 Problem Statement If I have a wallet connected to a ledger, every time I want to spend something I have to get my ledger out, doodle with it, use it, and then put it away securely JUST for a 5 Ada transaction. The trade off with using this device is I don’t want to lose all my Ada and still want to be more secure. But having to get my ledger every time will stop me from transacting as much or using Ada in the future.
 Solution Introduce skimming. What if there was a two wallet system that managed the trade off between both security and transacting.
  
Imagine two wallets: Wallet Savings Account and Wallet Transaction Account

                    <span>I was drawn to Cardano by the tokenomics and promise of decentralization. I noticed almost all the projects I see have a certain allocation (sometimes a big one) for VC money to get in before the rest of us. I’m sure there are reasons, but it’s always a major turn off for me. It doesn’t feel fair that institutional investors get in early at a lower price just because they are rich. Even projects using ISPO’s still take VC money. I thought the point of an ISPO was so that they could raise funds without having to go that route. 
 Is there something I’m missing here? Is it really totally impossible to make a successful project without taking VC money? Are there any good projects that are not taking any institutional money?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been away for a while and saw that there has been a recent hardfork (Alonzo). Does this mean that I have alonzo coins somewhere else if I held ADA in my Daedalus wallet? If so, how do I get them?

                    <span>I have some technical questions concerning the proposed projects on the Cardano ecosystem. I&#x27;m not expressing criticism, I&#x27;m merely an agnostic concerning the really technical coding &amp; architectural stuff.
 So, more and more countries are becoming interested in implementing digital solutions to citizen verification issues, among these solutions are blockchain solutions. I understood Ethiopia already signed some kind of memorandum of understanding with Cardano (Hoskinson), with Burundi being the latest country interested in utilizing the Cardano network for these things. However, I do have some questions.
 How would this technically take place? Can a dictatorial regime implement verification systems that are inherently immutable? If so, how does this immutability take place? If, for example…</span>

 Let&#x27;s go...
 Newly covered today: 
  
Pavia dropped a more detailed roadmap with live events scheduled for the plaza in Q3 2022. https://twitter.com/Pavia_io/status/1459246398046674945
 Charles is back in Colorado and has dropped a full AMA. https://youtu.be/nnDWc6uP6gs
 The November mid-month IOHK Development Update is now out! https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1459250049414799368
  
Previously Covered but still interesting:
  
In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano. https://twitter.com/seal_kiman/status/1443593563846193155

 It would be a big boom for us if we can show community demand / support.

                    <span>Hello, just wondering if there are yet any websites similar to Bitrefill that take Cardano as payment.

 What is it?
 It is an RPG board game that I am looking at implementing an app that goes alongside the game. The board game will be a series of different games that all use the same statistics and players can use characters between the games. With the App, it will be used to keep players statistics through the game but the reason I am posting it here is because I am looking at using NFTs on Cardano so that players can purchase new characters on the app. This will let players play the board games with your NFT characters.

                    <span>I&#x27;m really loving how the roadmap for 2022 Cardano is coming together. It&#x27;s a living ecosystem, growing, refining, adapting, and becoming stronger. The technology is unbelievable and we have so many great innovations coming to meet the hundreds of projects building on Cardano

                    <span>Is anyone creating some version of HEX on Cardano? We need this! Or at least we should have it. Obviously not with the huge amount to the founder, but something more fair, and with a website where people can see a graph of penalties paid. I really like the pumpamentals. People buy and stake to prevent dilution, and people who don&#x27;t stake are diluted, which means that stakers will have a larger percentage wise amount of tokens. And if people unstake too early, then stakers win even more, because of the penalties paid for unstaking too early. Also very limited supply, so the price can skyrocket, which will give an incentive to unstake early(to sell the token), which means more penalties paid and more for stakers. What&#x27;s not to like?
 Please someone make this. It is way better than stupid meme tokens, and I guess kinda easy to make compared to other projects. :-)

                    <span>Noticed that yesterday my entire ADA wallet value (yoroii) was sent to an address that&#x27;s not mine, in a transaction I did not authorize. 
 How can I get my coins back? I have the transaction data in my history.

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 Thinking of getting in on the ADALend private sale (it&#x27;s still on). What are your thoughts on it?
 Also, would be great if you could share your DYOR conclusions if you can, as I start doing mine.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Maybe you also missed this Summit news video: Bitrue exchange announced that ADA is becoming on of their base pairs. 
 And they will list Cardano DApps coins. 
 Does anyone has an account at Bitrue and can verify that ADA is now a base pair on their exchange ? 
 Not sure if it has something to do with that ADA acts as a stablecoin the last weeks. But a base pair coin has to be very stable . 
 Here the video https://youtu.be/NBLkaV7jH50 I just stumbled on .

                    <span>Is there any published data showing area were most of the ADA transactions are created? I would like to know if having nodes in those location (lower latency) help your stakepool? 
 Example, To me it does not make sense to have 2 relay nodes in same city. Seems better to spread them out..
 Any other thoughts?
 Thanks

                    <span>It&#x27;s my understanding that the max saturation limit for a stake pool is 64M.
 Does this mean when the pool we&#x27;re staking our ADA with reaches 64M, we need to manually find a new pool? Thanks!

                    <span>I’m not sure if this is possible and I suspect that this is a no, but is there anyway to link my app to my Trezor hardware wallet overview.
 Ideally I’d like to keep an eye on the amount and that which is being staked through through the APP.
 Fully aware I won’t be able to actually change or remove anything which connecting the Trezor to the laptop and moving it manually, however being able to see thing will always be nice.
 Anyone reading this thinking - I’m gonna pm the noob for their keys or tell him they need to be transferred somewhere else, please jog on. It’ll just be another account on the block and report list. 
 I’m not sure if I’m being really stupid but I can’t see an easy way to do this. Thanks in advance for your help 👌🏼

                    <span>Hello,
 I am looking to partner with someone to help build a DAO on Cardano. This person would be in charge of the technical side of the project. This project is ambitious, and I know this is a large task on any developer who answers this call. 
 The idea is rather simple. Users stake their Cardano within our DAO. In return, users earn our token. The DAO will keep the Cardano staking rewards. Then, users can use our token to vote on which non-profits / charities the DAO will donate the staking rewards to.
 A little bit about me, I have experience as a software project manager, and I have been involved in crypto for several years. 
 Thank you to anyone who shows interest in joining me on this venture. I welcome any feedback or questions about the project in the comments section.
 Regards,
 ExcelsiorDAO

                    <span>Hey all,
 would a one UTXO have multiple quantities for the same asset/token ?
 for example,

                    <span>So I want to learn how to mint native tokens on Cardano, specifically NFTs so I can start working on some ideas I have for NFT projects. I followed a guide to install a node on a VM (Ubuntu) and everything went fine until I let my laptop synch with the blockchain and while it was synching windows decided to make a random update and now I have some issues running it again. I have lost motivation about running it on my laptop, which maybe wasn&#x27;t the ideal choice because of the limited 8 GB ram it has. 
 Anyway I have a good PC with better specs but I have windows, can somebody give me some direction on a way to install and run a Cardano node and cli on Windows or is it just not a good option? I have Daedalus installed and that is a node from what I have read so can it save me time from installing a node or even synching with the blockchain? Sorry for the noob questions I&#x27;m still learning about this and remember all of this is just because I want to play around with minting my own nft&#x27;s.

                    <span>Hello Cardano developers,
 Some of you, including me, may feel that Haskell is very different from imperative programming languages. As a Python developer who got into Haskell because of Cardano, when learning this language, I could still see that Haskell, despite being very different, shares quite a lot similarities with Python. 
 As a practice and a form of learning reinforcement, I created a project, py2hs, to document how some frequently used programming patterns (e.g. functor, applicative) are implemented in Python and Haskell respectively. If you are a Python developer who just started learning Haskell, hope you can find this material helpful in some way.
 In terms of future development, I will keep improving existing contents and adding more examples as time allowed. Also, any contributions from the community is more than welcome. Hope we can together make it a better learning material and help more Cardano developers!
 Jerry

 I&#x27;d like to get more experience and knowledge by doing exercises..
 Could someone point me in the right direction and to some exercises or old homeworks?

                    <span>Data.Vector.Unboxed essentially gives a Structure of Arrays representation - Vector (a,b) can be stored as (Vector a, Vector b). 
 This has some minor issues - deriving doesn&#x27;t really work, writing the typeclass by hand is really annoying, GHC cannot optimize away dead reads if you only use one field - but overall it&#x27;s a reasonably nice and composable abstraction.
 I&#x27;m currently playing with some code which accepts messages and must store them efficiently before they get batch-executed. To make this extensible I&#x27;d like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.
 But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn&#x27;t matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.
 This lead me to a number of questions:
  
Is there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?
 Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational
 Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -&gt; Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values
 Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like
  
 
type ExtractPII &#x3D; { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; 
 If people have ideas to any of these points I&#x27;d really like to hear about them!

                    <span>Hello, I am working on two functions that filter values from a list of Cupcake type objects, and I am getting a &quot;Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive&quot; error when running them, which causes any example I try on them to give me *** Exception: Assessed3.hs:(25,1)-(31,67): Non-exhaustive patterns in function priceRange.
 I really don&#x27;t see anything wrong:
 priceRange :: Price -&gt; Price -&gt; [Cupcake] -&gt; [Cupcake]
 priceRange minprice maxprice [] &#x3D; []
 priceRange minprice maxprice [CC p i] &#x3D; [CC p i | pricelower minprice p, pricelower p maxprice]
 where
 pricelower :: Price -&gt; Price -&gt; Bool
 pricelower (P x) (P y) 
 | x&lt;&#x3D;y &#x3D; True
 | otherwise &#x3D; False
 Assessed3.hs:25:1: warning: [-Wincomplete-patterns]
 Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive
 In an equation for ‘priceRange’:
 Patterns not matched:
 (P _) (P _) ((CC (P _) []):_:_)
 (P _) (P _) ((CC (P _) (_:_)):_:_)
 |
 25 | priceRange minprice maxprice [] &#x3D; [] 
 For this it says I didn&#x27;t match the two cases in which the list inside is empty or non empty but I really don&#x27;t see how that will give me an error.

 By far the worst tho are people who assume that anyone who hates rich people is just jealous of them.
 Anyway, billionaires aren’t human and their heads belong on spikes. I sincerely hope we break out the guillotine for them in my lifetime.
 Kill the rich. They aren’t human and they don’t deserve our kindness or sympathy.

                    <span>Haskell’s laziness gives us
great
benefits,
but comes with costs.
One of the most visible cost of laziness is hard to predict memory behavior, and so we
have, and need, tools to profile and measure the heap of our Haskell programs.
Most of the time, we live in a high-level world of type classes, monoids, and
isomorphisms. But at the end of the day our code needs to run on actual
machines, and when our code is run it needs to be performant. Typically, “be
performant”, means “have reasonable computational complexity” and so we usually
focus on good asymptotic behavior instead of constant costs. But when our
programs meet our CPUs, constant costs are important, and thus having low level
tools is helpful for low level optimizations, i.e., when you want to squeeze
that last 10% out of your prog…</span>

                    <span>After being convinced of the usefulness of code formatters by the excellent scalafmt, which is very widely used in the Scala ecosystem, I was on the lookout for a similar tool for Haskell. In 2018, most options did not completely cut it for me, due to e.g. only formatting certain parts of the source file or having many unfortunate bugs. Upon discovering Ormolu in 2019, I was first appalled by its style, but this reaction was only short-lived, as I found these stylistic preferences to be easily malleable via familiarisation.
I started using Ormolu for all personal projects, and submitted bug reports and minor pull requests. Therefore, an internship to work on Ormolu full-time came like a call!

                    <span>Type-checking plugins for GHC are a powerful tool which allows users to
inject domain-specific knowledge into GHC’s type-checker. In this
series of posts, we will explore why you might want to write your own plugin, and how to do so.
I: Why write a type-checking plugin?
II: GHC’s constraint solver
III: Writing a type-checking plugin
In this first blog post of the series, I’ll be outlining a few
examples that showcase some limitations in GHC’s instance resolution
and type family reduction mechanisms. With a type-checker plugin, we
are no longer restricted by these limitations, and can decide ourselves
how to solve constraints and reduce type families.

Instance resolution
Recall how GHC goes about instance resolution, as per the user’s guide.
A typeclass instance has two components:
