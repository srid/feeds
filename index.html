                    <span>I&#x27;m interested in having a project built on the Cardano platform but would like to book some consultation time with a developer familiar with the protocol. I&#x27;d like to get a better idea of what is possible and what should be avoided.
 Specifically, my questions have to do with:
 - Gating website content with NFTs
 - Issuing a social token (along the lines of Rally.io)
 - Creating nesting NFTs (similar to Charged Particles)
 - Setting up and maintaining a stakepool
 - Understanding how smart contracts are conceptualized
 Although I do have a programming background, my intention is to hire a team to help bring my idea to life. As such, my questions are more about setting realistic expectations so that I can create a proper budget, build a preliminary timeline, and get a handle on the types of talent I will need to seek out.
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like to speak with someone who also has experience building web applications. 
 Feel free to DM me.
 Thanks

                    <span>A couple months ago it was big news that IOHK signed a &#x27;&#x27;contract&#x27;&#x27; with Ethiopia for their school ID system. Sounds great. But now i&#x27;m left to wonder... is any of that truly set in stone?
 I heard they just put in a bid for a contract, just like any company is able to do. And they don&#x27;t actually have anything official about working together set in stone. I tried to find Ehtiopian news about this. I have found one non-crypto source that stated that IOHK signed a Memorandum of Understanding, but that isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s atually legally enforcable. And that&#x27;s about all I could find through non-crypto news sources.
 If it&#x27;s just a bid for a contract, doesn&#x27;t that mean many companies can put forward solutions and they don&#x27;t have to pick Cardano&#x27;s blockchain at all? they can just say &#x27;&#x27;nah, I like this database better&#x27;&#x27; and go with something else?
 Oh and, what&#x27;s the point of the Cardano currency? The blockchain has utility, but is the token&#x27;s value just whatever we decide it is, like a cheerleader coin rooting for these projects?
 I promise you it&#x27;s not FUD, i feel like i have to make that very clear or I won&#x27;t get replies, it&#x27;s genuine questions.
 EDIT: ya&#x27;ll immediately: &#x27;wow i cant believe you&#x27;re spreading FUD, anyway i wont answer any of your questions.&#x27; great, thanks guys!

                    <span>I really don’t like entering my seed phrase, but I’m assuming the only way to get it up and running on my new phone is to do the restore seed phrase option. Is this correct?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been passionate about Cardano since 2017. However, it was only recently that I joined reddit specifically for the Cardano subreddit, and... I LOVE it! During these times of FUD and haters it is sooo great to have a place where I can read about Cardano from the perspective of people that really know a lot about it and are genuinely interested to learn more and exchange knowledge. Twitter is the opposite... just trolling, hating, shilling. Would you recommend any other social media groups for Cardano? I understand this is probably THE place to be, but just curious if there&#x27;s anything else I&#x27;m missing out on! Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hi All, 
 Apologies if this is an amateur questions. But I&#x27;ve been following SundaeSwap news a bit and I&#x27;m planning to re-delegate my ADA to one of the 30 pools which will provide SundaeSwap tokens through staking ADA. It seems like an easy enough way to get in on a new project. But I&#x27;m new to a lot of this. 
 However, my question is how will I actually receive those tokens? Many of these pools mention them being &quot;airdropped&quot; but I&#x27;m not familiar with that. 
 Will these tokens just appear in either my Yoroi or Daedalus wallets? Or will I need to take further steps to actually get them? 
 Thanks for any help!

What confuses me is that on the Google PlayStore it says it&#x27;s made by EMURGO Co., Ltd and 3K reviews In the Apple Store it says it&#x27;s made by Light Wallet by EMURGO and it only has 427 stars or ratings.

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I know it&#x27;s completely my fault, but I can&#x27;t believe it happened. I&#x27;m always as careful as I can when it comes to money, and I am not someone who trust easily. But this time I&#x27;ve been completely fooled.
 I&#x27;ve never mocked people being scammed or whose money has been stolen, but I never thought I would write a post being in the same situation. I&#x27;ve always thought it would never happen to me, probably like every people scammed :/.
 To contextualize, I just bought my first ADA yesterday. It&#x27;s been a long time I wanted to invest, and I bought as much as I could afford to loose, 1500ADA. Well, I didn&#x27;t hold long :&#x27;(

                    <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m graduating with my bachelor&#x27;s in Computer Science this spring. I want to work in blockchain technology and obviously it has to be Cardano. What do you see a need for in the Cardano ecosystem? Where I should go or what should I work on to get started?
 Financially I&#x27;m in a position where I could work for myself for a few years. I don&#x27;t think teaching myself Haskell will be much of a problem for me once my classwork is out of the way.
 What would you do if you were me?

 If 30something/45billion were minted, shouldn&#x27;t Cardano Foundation have more than 560 million in their reserve pools? Where is the rest of it?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve got a slow program in Advent of Code. I&#x27;d like to profile it to see what&#x27;s slow.
 I&#x27;ve got each day&#x27;s program as a different executable in a single Cabal project. You can see the code on Gitlab.
 Cabal 3.6.2, GHC 9.2.1.
 My Cabal file looks like this:

                    <span>I feel like it is something stupid that I&#x27;m doing, but I just cannot figure it out on my own. I created a simple project with cabal and it created basic project structure. I added another module that I called Work.hs into the same app folder that the Main.hs is at. VS Code doesn&#x27;t show any errors but when I run it with ghcid I get this error:
 app/Main.hs:5:1: error: Could not find module ‘Work’ Use -v (or &#x60;:set -v&#x60; in ghci) to see a list of the files searched for. | 5 | import Work

                    <span>Hi, I am very new to haskell and recently I decided to read a book called Linear algebra 
 [Theory , Intuition, Code]. This book uses python+MATLAB as it&#x27;s language but I don&#x27;t like python that much and I don&#x27;t know matlab so I have been wondering are there any libraries that cover the linearalgebra funcitonality of numpy?

 However I don&#x27;t have much Haskell knowledge (done learn you a Haskell and working on Haskell from first principals) Every job seems to require several years of experience with Haskell
 Are there jobs that are more like work studies or internships for learning Haskell? Where I can restart as a complete beginner to get experience?

                    <span>Twice a year — in May and November, nixpkgs maintainers and
contributors get together to fix as many build failures as possible
for the new release. The event is, as per tradition, called Zero Hydra
Failures, or ZHF for short.
This year, me and fellow hacker cab404
had organized a hackathon to help the cause and spread the Nix love
around. The basic premise was, quoting cab404:
Go—go—go!
We wanted to fix as many builds as possible, right before the
branchoff. Fixing the broken builds would allow NixOS 21.11 to have a more complete package
set.
The main point of this post is to share the experience with people
looking to organize similar events.

Preparation
Due to the current lockdown in Moscow, we
weren’t able to decide whether the hackathon would happen at all until

 Also bought a few hundred ADA to support the system. May my kids will be able to pay holidays by ADA some days :D

                    <span>I just saw this on twitter: I assume that makes the MuesliSwap DEX smart contract #1 at the moment? 
 MuesliSwap Cardano keeps growing!
 3 days ago we reported more than 20k interactions with our smart contract and now we already crossed the gigantic 30k mark. Big milestone for MuesliSwap and Cardano. Thank you for the incredible support.

 this graph represents transaction count per epoch and break it down to transaction type. As you can see, pink line represents transaction / epoch for Interacting with Plutus scrips (A.K.A Smart contracts). This metric is starting to boom and I really enjoy wathing it, so I wanted to share this with some who could be caught in the chaos and give some perspective where are we heading.

                    <span>Hi all, 
 I get that Cardano specifically chose an EUXTO Model. I get that this was chosen versus ETH&#x27;s model due to inherit advantages (though disadvantages also exist). I&#x27;ve got no problem with any of that. 
 However, if Smart Contracts (with the EUXTO Model) have been in development for literally years, then how did DEX projects not know about this upcoming issue? Shouldn&#x27;t this have been coordinated with the other projects? 
 Literally, every DEX followed through the Concurrency &quot;FUD&quot; with an elegant &quot;solution&quot; - which strikes me as a very odd choice of wording for something that&#x27;s supposed to be intentional....
 Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

                    <span>All hodlers of cardano, start normalizing the use of it as a form of liquidity (if you can). I mean that is what it is right, money... Extremely volatile, but money. 
 All these situations: Someone owes you only take ada You grandma gives you money for your bday, take ada Your mom asks you what you want for Christmas, take ada You own a small business, give small discount if they pay in ada You owe someone money tell them you will pay in ada Have a poker night but everyone just pays out in ada.
 Long story short, normalize it, get people talking about it, even if they say no. They still heard the words. If they are agree explain it to them, doesn&#x27;t have to be permanent tell them they can sell it right after, or hodl and get rich :).. let&#x27;s be honest setting up an account with an exchange is easy, plus they usually have a free $10 or something on account creation right? (They already have free money everybody wins). we as a community can make a buzz with every peer to peer currency interaction.
 So moral of the story, talk about ada in any exchange of money between peer to peer. If they are interested show them how, if not you talked about it and they may talk with someone else about how weird it was. Try to get them to buy it and transfer to you, don&#x27;t take cash and buy it with their money, get a new buyer, that now knows how to buy ada on an exchange.
 If this is a stupid post, please be kind with the down votes, I just think us as a community can do our own marketing and normalization of cardano.
 EXAMPLE: This weekend I am hosting my very first crypto poker, all in ada. Half of the people playing just created their account and are playing with their free account money.

                    <span>Honestly it&#x27;s hard for me to see what these 2 have contributed this year. I remember that Emurgo created a 100 Million developer fund for Africa but that&#x27;s it. 
 Why does their role seem so small? What are they working on? What can we do as a community to help/support/put more pressure on them?

                    <span>I was reading up about cardano monitory policy at
 https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/monetary-policy/
 and the document mentioned the reserves are the main source of ADA for the delegator and pool rewards in the beginning. I was wondering if there is a way to find out how much ada is in the reserves at a given time?
 Am I correct in assuming that its, total supply (45bil) minus the circulating supply ?

 Introduction
 We have tools to &quot;explore&quot; the Cardano blockchain. These tools are very useful when you know what you&#x27;re looking for. We argue that there&#x27;s a different, complementary use-case which is to &quot;observe&quot; the blockchain and react to particular event patterns.
 Oura is a rust-native implementation of a pipeline that connects to the tip of a Cardano node through a combination of Ouroboros mini-protocol (using either a unix socket or tcp bearer), filters the events that match a particular pattern and then submits a succinct, self-contained payload to pluggable observers called &quot;sinks&quot;.
 Etymology
 The name of the tool is inspired by the tail command available in unix-like systems which is used to display the end of a text file or piped data. &quot;Oura&quot; is the ancient greek word for &quot;tail&quot;. Cardano&#x27;s Ouroboros consensus protocol name comes from the ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail, which means &quot;tail eating&quot;.
 Status
 Oura is an open-source project licensed under Apache-2.0. It&#x27;s still very much a WIP, but we do have a working PoC. We&#x27;re looking #Rust developers to contribute. More info in the Github Repo

 Would that be enough to work on anything in this ecosystem? Not on the smart contracts themselves ofc but idk.. maybe someone’s writing something in java? anyways i dont have much free time but I’ll gladly help for free(experience) if there’s any cool project who might think of me as useful .. Lemme hear ur thoughts:) ty

                    <span>I am seeking someone to partner with who can teach Haskell to absolute beginners. And when I say beginners - I mean zero programming experience. 
 This would be an online class - taught for 2 hours per day. Time of day and length of course to be determined. 
 This person will need to develop the class material without references to other programming languages or concepts. 
 Message me to discuss.
 Edit: 1. Time zone is one of the 4 US mainland time zones 2. Assumed knowledge would be high school and fluent English 3. Targeted toward Cardano smart contracts 4. Using whatever device they own (if there are device requirements that can be communicated to students prior to sign up) 5. Moneys is to be determined based off of length of class and number of students.

                    <span>Wanted to know if there&#x27;s been work around this yet: with eslint, you can extend a base config pulled in via npm and add on your application&#x27;s specific customizations. This centralizes the config in 1 place for all apps. Wanting to do the same with our Haskell linter, so hoping that hlint could do that. I don&#x27;t see that nor can I find examples of it. Does anyone know if that exists?

I always run it in GHCI, and when I was using Stack I&#x27;m pretty sure I could rebuild incrementally. But then it stopped building in Stack, so I switched to Cabal, which only lets me rebuild incrementally for one subproject at a time -- if I make changes to another subproject, I have to quit and rerun cabal ghci. So suddenly compilation was taking a long time.
 I ducked the problem by just making it a monorepo again. But it made me wonder -- how hard would it be to make compiled code content-addressed, like Unison does?

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/rg7kmp/how_to_build_a_list_comprehension_with_unknown/">

                    <span>List comprehension is a very appealing feature in Haskell. It could support a form of non-deterministic computation. 
 For example,
  [[x,y] | x &lt;- [0..2], y &lt;- [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] 
 However, this construct is too static. I mean that these two generators (x &lt;- [0..2] and y &lt;- [0..2]) are solidified in the code. If the number of generators is unknown (e.g. List of generators as input), there is no way to use the List comprehension gracefully. 
 One way to solve the problem is using Traversable:
  sequenceA [[0..2], [10..12]] -- [[0,10],[0,11],[0,12], -- [1,10],[1,11],[1,12], -- [2,10],[2,11],[2,12]] 
 Now we have a List of generators. So far so good.
 The drawback of this approach is that it cannot handle the variables&#x27; references in a generator&#x27;s body.
 For example, 
  [[x,y] | x &lt;- [0..2], y &lt;- [10*x..10*x+2]] 
 We cannot represent [10*x..10*x+2] in sequenceA.
 Question:
 Is there any general way to do this job in Haskell? Maybe something like sequenceA, but can handle variables&#x27; references. Or do we have to write a small interpreter?
 Thanks
  
Edit:
 Some one possibly misunderstand my question.
 For example, if we just using List comprehension (or do-notation), how do we represent the following pattern in general way?
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; [[x1] | x1 &lt;- [0..2]]
 [[x1,x2] | x1 &lt;- [0..2], x2 &lt;- [10x1..10x1+2]]
 [[x1,x2,x3] | x1 &lt;- [0..2], x2 &lt;- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 &lt;- [100x2..100x2+2]]
 [[x1,x2,x3,x4] | x1 &lt;- [0..2], x2 &lt;- [10x1..10x1+2], x3 &lt;- [100x2..100x2+2], x4 &lt;- [1000x3..1000x3+2]]
 -- and so on &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It could be solved by code generation and interpreter pattern, but I hope a better way. It would be nice if code can be seen as data (e.g. List).

                    <span>I&#x27;m hiring Haskell developers again, for the Core Strats team of Modeling and Analytics. The head of our group has given a talk at the Haskell Implementer&#x27;s Workshop last month where he described the team and what we do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;A70SN7vFsKU
 ​
 Applications must go via these links:
 Warsaw: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;128083
 London: https://scb.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?job&#x3D;2100029752
 ​
 The Warsaw position is open to both contractors and direct employment, whereas the London one is only open for direct employment. Standard Chartered supports (practically fully) remote working, but only from the country of payroll (PL or UK in this case), and after an initial 3-month in-office period (where circumstances allow). We will cover visa and relocation costs for successful employment applicants.
 Note that the first step of the application is a Valued Behaviours Assessment and it is quite important: our team won&#x27;t be able to see your application until you pass this assessment.

                    <span>Hello Haskellers!
 Cutting to the chase: I have a cabal project for Advent of Code, and would like to profile it. I am familiar with profiling single *.hs files, but I would like to be able to profile the entire project.
 What is the recommended best practice for doing this with cabal? I tried google, but it appears as though my googlefu need some work. My cabal file, as well as the rest of the project can be found here.
 If any more information is needed, please do let me know!

 I&#x27;m a little reluctant to as there are some server changes that you have to do to allow for the Nami wallet integration into the website.
 There are a few key features so far.
 1) Nami wallet integration This allows for a bunch of cool Web3 functionality with the Nami wallet. We&#x27;ll integrate in Yoroi Dapp Connector and Typhon as well.
 2) Interaction with whats in a wallet. It will pull in and display for a user what is stored in their wallet based on Policy ID. If you have a website for a specific collection, you can add in all the policy IDs and it will filter the collection of your wallet on the websit…</span>

                    <span>The issue of concurrency arises for any decentralized application that allows multiple users interact with it, if the results of user actions are not independent from each other. Cardax is an automated market-maker (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX), which makes it a prime example of such a concurrent decentralized application. At any given time, we expect that multiple liquidity providers may want to deposit/withdraw liquidity and multiple traders may want to swap liquidity. Each of these actions affects the liquidity reserves in the DEX and each swap may affect the prices for subsequent actions.
 We have developed a general-purpose algorithm (we call it “streaming merge”) that will allow our users to interact with our protocol concurrently without interruption or interference from anyone…</span>

                    <span>I am on an iPhone. Been using the Yoroi wallet app without issue. 
 Did the update today and now when I open the app it just says, “Welcome Back - Authorize with your biometrics”
 But then nothing happens and it does not actually attempt any type of login. 
 Hitting the option at the bottom “Use other login method” does nothing at all. 
 Anyone else run into this after the latest app update today?

                    <span>Messari published a 165 pages long report on cryptos. Yet they could only wrote 2 sentences about Cardano. The first one starts: &quot;Cardano is in the top 10, so this may seem like a slight, but not a single person in my network recommended&quot;. 
 I have a Deja Vu feeling.
 But they were able to report a hole subsection about a blockchain with Proof Of Restart consensus.

                    <span>Hi guys,
 Recently I&#x27;ve been doing some research around Cardano&#x27;s stablecoins. 
 So far it seems like it&#x27;s going to be Djed issued by Coti and dUSD issue by Ardano.
 Any thoughts on these projects?
 Also in this article https://medium.com/cotinetwork/why-being-the-issuer-of-djed-cardanos-official-stablecoin-is-a-game-changer-for-coti-f4945494fc40 Coti claims that Djed is going to be Cardano&#x27;s official stablecoin.
 Is it true? Is there such a thing as an official stablecoin? Or will there be2-3 stablecoins cohabit in the cardano blockchain the same way USDT and USDC do on Ethereum?
 ​
 Thanks

                    <span>Hello everyone. Lately, I&#x27;ve been very interested in developing my skills within the cryptocurrency industry and have been pondering if working within the spear is a viable option for me.
 To provide some background, I am a college graduate living in the US with a computer science degree and I&#x27;m very interested in the ideals of cryptocurrency and the technology behind it. I&#x27;d love to learn how to program on the blockchain, specifically on Cardano. At the present moment, I have the opportunity to work on an up-and-coming metaverse project but I&#x27;m wary regarding the legality of making money through such means. The only reason that I&#x27;m cautious is the precarious situation crypto finds itself in the US. If I make ADA through this project, am I infringing on any laws that prohibit me from making a living by receiving ADA as payment?
 I&#x27;m well aware Reddit is probably not the best place to be asking for legal advice, but I&#x27;d figure I&#x27;d see if anyone had any insight that could help me. Thanks for the read.
 TLDR: Unsure about legality regarding making money from a crypto project in the USA

                    <span>Hello, I&#x27;m trying to build a NFT marketplace on Cardano but I have a little trouble understanding the process. I&#x27;m used with wordpress type scripts, where all I do is through ftp, but now I found this code https://github.com/OnChainLabs/Martify and I don&#x27;t understand what to do, how can I install this on my website domain ? 
 I want to publish NFT collections just like https://www.jpg.store/

                    <span>Hi all, apologies if this has been discussed before. I&#x27;m struggling to find the resources that will help me understand this particular area of smart contracts.
 Is it possible to have a time-based smart contract that runs for a long time, as in years? I&#x27;m trying to determine if a smart contract on Cardano would be a good choice for implementing a company vesting schedule (ie, being granted a certain number of tokens periodically, according to a specific schedule). 
 I feel like I&#x27;m not thinking about this correctly. Would appreciate any pointers!

 I&#x27;ve been using ghcup to manage and install ghc, stack, and cabal on my mac. Now I tried installing ghc on windows with Chocolatey and Haskell Platform. It installs version 9.2.1 by default with &#x60;choco install haskell-dev&#x60;. I need version 8.10.7 installed since some packages that I&#x27;m using are not yet supported under 9.2.1. What&#x27;s the recommended way to install 8.10.7. Is ghcup a viable alternative? I tried it and it seems not to have &quot;tui&quot; available on Windows for some reason.
 Thank you!

                    <span>I am trying to upgrade GHC from 8.10.7 to 9.X.X. I am very new to Cabal/Stack/GHC, but wanting to get into Haskell development after really enjoying LINQ and F# as a full time C# engineer.
 ​
 I have brew (3.3.7), stack (2.7.3), and Cabal (3.6.2) installed, and I thought something as simple as &quot;cabal update&quot; or &quot;brew update&quot; or &quot;stack update&quot; would somehow magically work.
 ​
 For context, I am used to archlinux where arch documentation, a simple pacman -Syu or grabbing from the AUR solves 99.98% of my problems. But I am relatively new to apple hardware for development.
 Thanks a ton, and I apologize for the ignorance.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been using Backblaze for a few years for my home computer. You know how everyone keeps telling you, a backup is only a true backup once you&#x27;ve done at least one restore? Now I know why (silly me).
I just got a &quot;Safety Freeze&quot; error [1] - essentially some inconsistency with my backup. Backblaze will not tell me the actual cause of this inconsistency. It&#x27;s possible that some data might be missing - Backblaze doesn&#x27;t tell me though.
The only official solution is to manually check all files (millions in my case). I also can&#x27;t download a full backup since Backblaze only allows downloads of up to 500GB at once. So my only option is to do a full hard drive restore, costing $189 + customs in Europe, so at the end probably closer to 300€. But even then I won&#x27;t know if/which of my data was corrupted.
What bugs me is that the Backblaze desktop software should be able to resolve this - it should be possible to do a hash of all the files that are in the most recent backup, and cross-check it with the hashes of the files on my machine.
Not sure what I should do now.
Edit: This is the response from the Backblaze support:
&gt; I apologize, but this [&#x3D;manually checking all files] would in fact be the only sure fire way if you are concerned about any deleted files. There wouldn&#x27;t be a way to compare hashes the way you describe in this case as that mechanism is simply not implemented into the Backblaze software. The Backblaze software is intended to prevent data loss. It would not be intended to be able to automatically cross reference local and server data against each other to display what is and is not backed up on our servers.
They can&#x27;t be serious with this?

                    <span>I have a question regarding how slot leaders are selected. I understand that this selection process happens right before the Epoch begins. I also know that every stake pool has a chance of being a slot leader proportionate to the amount of ADA they have staked with them. 
 How exactly is this drawing executed in a decentralized and verifiably random way? 
 If a stake pool isn’t online when it’s their turn to mine a block, how how does the network choose another leader?

                    <span>So I&#x27;m in the process of building a way for cardano to fight crypto legislation and will post here again when complete.
 I could use a leg up on a summary of all the crypto bills that exist in the US. 
 Has anyone seen a google doc breaking down/tracking the blockchain/crypto laws and summarizing the impact? I know Charles has posted an infographic but curious if there is a place to track these.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I want to move some savings into ADA for long term storage. I was going to get a ledger nano to store them but, while it does support ADA, it doesn&#x27;t support all the coins I&#x27;m interested in. I would like to keep everything in one place so I was planning on using something like a raspberry pi with multiple desktop wallets on it, stored offline in a physical safe.
 Doing some research I have found daedalus that requires you to set up a &quot;full node&quot;. I&#x27;m new to all of this crypto terminology so I just wanted to double check that I can
  
set up a full node on a raspberry pi
 create a wallet
 transfer funds from exchange to wallet
 shutdown pi and put it in a safe for multiple years.
  
When I decide to transfer my funds back to an exchange is it as easy as turning on the pi, resyncing the node, and transferring out of my wallet to an exchange?
 Thanks for the help!

                    <span>Hello,
 Just a reminder that there is a reason why pool can become saturated - the idea behind it is to tackle centralization which is caused by too many people delegating to one large pool that would be in control of majority of network and could start doing all sorts of nasty things.
 It doesn&#x27;t really work, because many large pool operators ignore the saturation limits and simply create a farm of multiple pools. But just because this is technically possible, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s right, they are still a single centralized entity, just spread into more pools.
 Centralization harms the value of whole chain and also some of the largest farms have so extreme ADA income that they simply sell most of it on CEXes pushing the value even lower, unlike small pools that usually readd their rewards into pledge in order to remain competitive.
 If you already stake with a pool farm, please consider switching to a single pool. There are many of them that have lowest possible margin and ROI even better than some of the huge pool farms (just check on adapools if the pool is member of &quot;single pool operators&quot;, if not, they are a pool farm). Best pools would be those in &quot;single pool alliance&quot; - those pools are committed to never run more than 1 pool - https://adapools.org/alli/cardano-single-pool-alliance/6
 Thanks for keeping the network decentralized!

                    <span>So I have a problem, Im trying to stake for the Sundaeswap airdrop, but when i go to put some ADA to do it the amount is automatically the whole wallet’s amount. How can i change it to a custom amount? If i do stake the whole wallet can i unstake without having to deposit more ADA to unstake?
 Kinda new btw, thanks though

                    <span>Cardano has now crossed the 1 million staking wallets milestone. Makes me wonder how many wallets people have. 
 Like is it common for a whale to keep a million in each of 100 wallets or keep 100 million in one wallet?

                    <span>After the meld ispo finished, i decided to stake with one of the Empowa pools until the sundaeswap ispo starts. I personally think that the realfi approach and the ideas regarding housing in Africa are very promising and are in line with my personal ideals. Furthermore, the fact that Empowa is aiming for concrete, real word utility should be pretty valuable when everything gets up and running. 
 So why is there so little attention being given to Empowa? Is there anything i am missing, or am i misinterpreting the value of the project?

                    <span>I have daedalus on my pc. When I first got into ADA and wanted to stake i chose daedalus because I didn&#x27;t want a light wallet like Yoroi on my phone. It was just a personal preference. Also it is more secure because it is an actual node.
 I&#x27;ve seen posts about people complaining that daedalus takes to long to load for some. Here is why. I watched Charles&#x27; recent AMA on YouTube and a question about daedalus being too slow was asked. Charles replied with why. Downloading a whole node is very heavy software. You have to have the appropriate hardware for it to run. When I first downloaded it, it took about 7 hours to sync. That&#x27;s normal for the first time. Now it&#x27;s about 10-15 min.
 I didn&#x27;t know why it took so long until Charles said that but, it makes sense now. Heavy software needs decent hardware. He said that using a BTC node or and ETH node is the same. I say again heavy software needs good hardware. 
 Daedalus being released first was the main focus so that the Cardano network could get fully decentralized faster. Then came the light wallets. In the recent AMA he said that daedalus is a big focus for 2022 to make sync times faster. They are working on it. 
 Sidebar: anyone else appreciating these discount prices as much as me? 
 Some transparency: i am in no way shape or form a whale. I buy when I can afford it. I believe in cardano and it&#x27;s future in making the world a better place. 
 Much love to the ADAGANG.

                    <span>The Daedalus wallet just gets harder and harder to load, but it always eventually loaded, but today I can not get it to load. Every time it takes forever to open and then starts syncing but somewhere around 98% synced it loses connection again. I&#x27;ve been trying since this afternoon, it&#x27;s now 12:54AM lol. I&#x27;m running it on a gaming laptop with 12mb ram. It&#x27;s always slowed down the computer but I don&#x27;t use it for anything else other than Daedalus but now its at the point that when it does load I can&#x27;t use the computer for anything else at all it&#x27;s that slow.
 I plan on adding more RAM but for now I&#x27;m concerned that I get get the wallet to open and sync at all. I&#x27;ve never had this much trouble. 
 Am I overlooking something? Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.

                    <span>Background: A month ago I bought a Nano Ledger and transfered my ADA to a newly created wallet within the device. I was able to recover all the Yoroi Wallet I used or have used to do it. About a week ago I attempted to recover my old Yoroi Wallet to use on the SundaeSwap testnet (at the time I didn&#x27;t know I could only use Nami). I could not recovery any of my old wallets.
 I attempted the recovery process again today and I was able to bring back one wallet, but I still can&#x27;t get my other. I know my recovery phrase is correct because I can pull the wallet up in Adalite. Stranger yet, I know Yoroi is accepting every word except the first.
 I searched Twitter and this subreddit. I&#x27;ve seen post about Yoroi having synchronization issues, but only one old post really like my issue. Has anyone else had these problems?

                    <span>Given the excitement about staking in pools to relieve Sundae&#x27;s, many, if not all, of the eligible pools are at full saturation (unless I overlooked one), I have a couple questions. I know it&#x27;s not live but if any of you have any insight I would appreciate it. 1) will Sundae rewards diminish in the same way Ada rewards decrease when a pool is saturated?...... Well I guess that&#x27;s my only question actually. Thanks!

                    <span>Hi Everybody,
 I was an Ethereum dev that felt in love with Cardano several months ago. After some hesitations I finally decided to deep dive into Haskell and understand how to create a Plutus Smart Contract. But, you know, it’s a winding road.
 I’m currently working on the white paper of a new DAO that is basically a VC fund on blockchain. Till now, the logic I put in place (not technical, just conceptual) is blockchain agnostic. In other words, I delayed as much as possible the implementation to focus on the DAO mechanics.
 Now, the time has arrived and I have to chose between Ethereum and Cardano.
 Since I was an Ethereum dev it’d be easier to develop it in solidity, but gas cost and the huge number of active DAOs today is scaring me. Cardano is great but I just started studying it, so I really don’t know if it can be suitable for a complex DAO.
 Do you have any suggestion? Do you think Cardano is a good choice for an investment based DAO?
 Thank you in advance guys!

 Currently, I have to download the package source code and untar it into stackproject/src and I can use those hidden module in my code.
  
Obviously, the obvious question is is there any simple way to import hidden module?

                    <span>Hello!
 I don&#x27;t understand how to get an index of locally available documentation and installed packages.
 I added the flag: &quot;Documentation: True&quot;, and indeed if I navigate to: &#x27;~/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.7/attoparsec-0.14.3-a88f9f2009aaf50ec4de28c96eaab575e97e192943bebbfec18a608dffd670fd/share/doc/html&#x27;, all the docs are there, and they even link back to the ghc documentation (in &#x27;file:///home/jurjen/.ghcup/ghc/8.10.7/share/doc/ghc-8.10.7/html/libraries&#x27;), which is great!
 But navigating or exploring to such funky directories is unwieldy and I cannot find a generated index and they are not linked into the standard index living in &#x27;ghcup/.../share/doc/ghc-8.10/html&#x27; which is annoying since that is my main source of information for installed packages.
 I tried to set the options 
  docdir: /home/jurjen/.ghcup/share/doc/$abi/html/libraries/$libname htmldir: /home/jurjen/.ghcup/share/doc/$abi/html haddockdir: $htmldir 
 But that didn&#x27;t seem to do nothing. Anyone know how to make a global index of all (user) installed packages with cabal?

                    <span>After learning Haskell for some time, I would say that grasping most libraries and using them to build applications is a doable task, what really puzzles me is how to cultivate the mindset to enable one to build complex libraries. Some examples would be servant (type-level concept), scotty (monad transformer concept), opaleye (profunctor concept), and a lot more. Many Haskell libraries use sophisticated techniques to achieve DSL, but we seem to lack learning materials (the design parts, not the practical usage parts) that are accessible to everyday programmers.

                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id&#x3D;29524781">

                    <span>The HN homepage has five ranks colored black rather than gray. Currently this is &quot;Learning how to ride a bike&quot;, &quot;Log4j: Between a rock and a hard place&quot;, &quot;How to train your decision-making AIs&quot;, &quot;Carolina Gold was once the most popular rice grown in America (2019)&quot;, and &quot;Packaging for instant coffee made out of seaweed&quot;. It seems to follow the story, e.g. the bike story was #12 before and now it&#x27;s #13: the color moved with it. They do not have in common a recent/old submission time, high/low score, or high/low comments.
The HTML difference is &#x60;$rank&#x60; being inserted around the rank.
It also shows up in incognito mode with the same ones colored black, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s account-related.
(Some rambling follows, I&#x27;m not actually serious about a secret hidden meaning, just a toy idea. Most likely it&#x27;s something like low comment downvotes to attract attention to the story.)
My first thought was that the numbers had a hidden meaning as a puzzle or respect, maybe someone died who invented the equivalent of a Fibonacci sequence. Looking in the OEIS, 1,4,6,12,18 did not mean anything obvious (http://oeis.org/search?q&#x3D;1%2C4%2C6%2C12%2C18). Then I noticed the numbers changed... but not pseudorandomly, but with the stories, so it seems that the numbers are irrelevant. Is it about the title? If you read the first title character of each, you get LCHPL. If you read the 1st character of the first, the 2nd character of the 2nd, etc., you get LAWKN. Not yet seeing that hidden meaning.
Edit: To everyone saying a hot indicator, I thought of that and it doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense. E.g. go to page 3 and observe this one being black:
&gt; 4 points by [user] 7 hours ago
There are currently (22:47 UTC) actually 3 black on the third page, which seems a bit inconsistent with what I saw earlier (earlier: first page had 4, next page had 1, next page had 0).

                    <span>Hello, I don&#x27;t want to look like I shill some other coin I hold, but I noticed that NavCoin created a bridge to BSC in the past. I don&#x27;t perfectly understand how it works under the hood, but it seems that they are using some kind of crypto black magic, where you create a special &quot;dual wallet&quot; that uses same cryptography on both chains and using BSC smart contract you can either lock coins on one side and release them on another, or the other way. So either you have NAV on NavCoin chain, or wNAV on BSC chain, both tokens being fully interchangeable.
 On top of that you can even keep wNAV you moved to BSC still staked on native NavCoin chain (just FYI NavCoin is PoS UTXO chain, similarly to Cardano).
 Is it possible to create similar kind of bridge also to Cardano? If yes, how? Do Cardano smart contracts support such a thing? I think that both chains would tremendously benefit from such bridge. NavCoin doesn&#x27;t have smart contracts at all, but on other hand it has privacy coin (xNAV), which Cardano is lacking and to be honest I don&#x27;t think Cardano is ever going to support any privacy coin. So this way we could get best of the two worlds. Is this theoretically possible?

                    <span>TLDR: This post is about Cardano, SingularityNet and the projects in Catalyst F7 and some of my personal experience
 ​
 ERC20 converter is available on Cardano testnet. This is such a nice gift that will usher a new era in 2022. SingularityNet AGIx test tokens from ERC20 can now be converted to AGIx Cardano token on testnet. I personally tried this on first day of the testnet release. So why am I excited about this?
 SingularityNet opens up a new era of development on Cardano. If you are working in the field of AI then you know that it is pretty much infested with big tech companies. You either have to work for them or you have to be in an academic research institute or release your model in a git repository. SingularityNet opens up this space. It enabled democratized AI development. It pr…</span>

                    <span>Has this been posted before? It appears that ETH POS is energy-intensive compared to that of Cardano.
 https://www.yahoo.com/now/proof-stake-ethereum-2-0-153221744.html
 It was also previously found that the ETH POS has vulnerability issues:

                    <span>You are all probably aware that Yoroi changes wallet addresses each time you send to it for privacy, but that the old ones are technically still active. Some centralized companies like Celsius allow for ADA wallets but the addresses don’t change. CDC apparently DOES change the ADA wallet every transaction but doesn’t mention this clearly anywhere on their platform.
 So when I copied the CDC address I wanted to send to from my Yoroi transaction history, I had no idea it would not actually be going to my CDC wallet and now my ADA is gone.
 If you are sending ADA to CDC, copy the address from the CDC app and not Yoroi so it actually reaches you. Learn from my mistake

                    <span>Having watched a bunch of videos I fairly clear on how a main principle of smart contracts on Cardano is that they perform validation. However, I’m concerned / curious about the level of decentralisation that will be possible if there is a huge amount of logic off chain in centralised entities. 
 To help understand where the line is, I’d really appreciate someone with technical knowledge helping answer this question:
 Could you build a dapp where you deposit, say 100 ada and you get paid back 10 ada per month, purely executed on chain, with no ‘scoopers’ or outside apps running a process?
 Understanding how you could do the above would really help me and others understand the model and potential much better I think.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>So I have been recently reading about so many stories where users send their coins to the wrong address, and thus absolutely erasing it. E-transfers are very common in banks where we create a password, and the money can only get deposited if the other user enters the password. The money would then get returned within 30 days if it was not accepted. Is this something that is already in use, and why haven&#x27;t we seen a system like this? I believe this would be quite a nice safety measure when sending from wallet to wallet. Is this even possible?

                    <span>Ok so I&#x27;m trying to get my friends, who are not involved in crypto at all, into cardano. Everyone I talk to is very interested but I can&#x27;t get them to take the leap and grab a bag. So I want to send them a video of Charles Hoskinson talking about cardano to convince them to take the leap. What would you consider the best Video of Charles Hoskinson to watch to get someone into crypto and cardano. Drop a link if you know a good one! TIA

                    <span>I want to start off by first saying... Yes, I hold Cardano. Matter of fact, it is my Second/Third largest (depending on the current market price) that I&#x27;m currently holding. Now that-that is out of the way, here is my take on ADA.
 If you hold a decent sized amount of ADA and did any kind of research, then you know and should be full aware that ADA is and was a long term hold (HODL) after doing your Due Diligence. You would have known that the price was bloated and could not have maintained that market cap without a single working DEX. It&#x27;s just not reality. Cardano and CH deserve an A+ when it comes to marketing. This brings me to my next point..

 Created by an Ethereum co-founder, Cardano was designed to improve on Ethereum’s downfalls when it comes to network efficiency and dapp creation. The platform aims to solve the blockchain “trilemma” of scalability, decentralization and security. To date, Cardano is the biggest and most successful blockchain platform to operate off of a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus.

                    <span>I tagged it as AoC since my question came up doing one of those problems but its more of a general question I&#x27;d say.... 
 So I learned about Advent of Code and wanted to use it to learn some more Haskell.
 I did the first day, which went well. However I struggle with the second one...
 In theory it shouldn&#x27;t be too complicated.. My approach was as follows:
  
Read the lines
 Split the lines in 3 different lists (depending in the first character)
 Sum up all values
 ---
  
1.-2. were no problem.
 With 3 I thought I can just use foldl like that 
 foldl (\ p c -&gt; p + read (last c)) 0 testInputf
 where testInputf is a list of Strings ([String]).
 For me it would make sense that c is the whole String and last c is the last element of the String... However this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case here... if I write it like that Haskell throws an error saying, that 
  Couldn&#x27;t match type ‘Char’ with ‘[Char]’ Expected type: [[String]] Actual type: [String] 
 And I can&#x27;t figure out why... Is there anything Im missing? Is there a general way of getting all last elements out of the Strings in a String List?
 For testing purposes Ive also tried using map 
 map (read . last) testInputf 
 which throws the same error and I can&#x27;t figure out why...
 Thank you very much!

                    <span>Hi, r/haskell,
 I am working on Chameleon, an experimental visual type debugging tool for Haskell. A couple of months ago I posted an advertisement for a user study for Chameleon. After that post, I was overwhelmed by a very generous amount of participation and constructive feedback from the wholesome r/haskell community. This time I want to conduct the study with more complicated code challenges. Some of the code I took from real-life Haskell projects, such as Cabal, hledger, xmonad,etc.
 If you are interested in helping us with our human-centered programming research, or you want to check out our Haskell type debugging tool, please click this link to proceed https://sup.ercu.be. The study is anonymous, and it will take you about 20 - 30 minutes to complete. But in turn, it will help us immensely.
 I am happy to answer any questions regarding Chameleon in this thread.
 Thank you,
 Shuai, Interactive Haskell Type Inference Exploration Team

                    <span>Edit:
 Based on the comments by u/p3tr4gon, u/psycotica0, I kind of understand how this partially applied type constructor works like.
 My little example use-case:
 type IntMap v &#x3D; Map.Map Int v --says IntMap is a Map with an Int key and some type v Value --my toy example function to return an IntMap String intMap :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; IntMap String intMap num str &#x3D; Map.singleton num str --and from the original question this also worked someAssocList &#x3D; [(1, &quot;John&quot;), (2, &quot;Lisa&quot;), (3, &quot;Mary&quot;), (4, &quot;Sandra&quot;)] myIntMap &#x3D; Map.fromList someAssocList :: IntMap String --------------------------------------------------------------------- --ghci output below Prelude&gt; :r [1 of 1] Compiling Shapes ( ch8_types.hs, interpreted ) Ok, one module loaded. *Shapes&gt; intMap 2 &quot;Noah&quot; fromList [(2,&quot;Noah&quot;)] *Shapes&gt; myIntMap fromList [(1,&quot;Noah&quot;),(2,&quot;Lisa&quot;),(3,&quot;Mary&quot;),(4,&quot;Sandra&quot;)] 
 And I agree that this is a toy example that probably does not have many use cases.
 Original question:
 In Learn You a Haskell 8.5, they have this example
 --partially apply type constructor type IntMap v &#x3D; Map.Map Int v type IntMap&#x27; &#x3D; Map.Map Int 
 How would I use this? I only know how to make a so-called IntMap like this
 import qualified Data.Map as Map someAssocList &#x3D; [(1, &quot;John&quot;), (2, &quot;Lisa&quot;), (3, &quot;Mary&quot;), (4, &quot;Sandra&quot;)] myIntMap &#x3D; Map.fromList someAssocList --deleted due to typo please see edits above

                    <span>Breakthrough.
 I&#x27;ve been grumbling here about ways in which Cardano DEXes seem too centralized, but at the same time freely admitting that I don&#x27;t fully understand how they work. I&#x27;ve been reading and seeking enlightenment. Most of the whitepapers for Maladex, Liqwid, SundaeSwap, etc. don&#x27;t quite tell me what I (and, judging from postings I see here, what others), need to know.
 I&#x27;m finally getting somewhere, though, and wanted to re-link to this video, posted to Reddit a week ago by u/lukasbradley, here, and add, for those like me who don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; Cardano DEXes, that the speaker being interviewed in that video provides a really lucid explanation of how things work - how the eUTxO model allows users to specify the conditions under which a particular contract executes, and puts those conditions right into the eUTxO, which is signed by the user. He talks, in an informal way that I personally &quot;get,&quot; about how the account, UTxO, and eUTxO models differ and what this means for software engineers like him.
 The key is that the eUTxO model allows for a finely-tuned, predictable, conditional execution by the DEX. You&#x27;re giving up a very precise amount of control to the DEX, and making it conditional.
 Quiz: When done, you should be able to explain how the owner, witness, datum, and redeemer all function in a Cardano eUTxO.
 I know everything said in that video has been said before, but that video somehow put things all together for me. Please, anyone still confused about the difference between building a DEX for an account, and an (e)UTxO, model, watch this. It&#x27;ll help.

                    <span>I am considering getting a team of fellow entrepreneurs together to build cardano&#x27;s first mobile decentralized application browser to compete with the Ethereum and layer 2 scaling ecosystems options. 
 There&#x27;s a handful of mobile decentralized application browsers today between Trust (Binance), Coinbase Wallet, Status, etc. but nothing like this exists for cardano&#x27;s current and coming applications yet.
 I think this will be highly important in the next wave of web3 adoption, including with a social application I already have in mind. 
 Is anyone in the community interested in this? If so, how important do you think it is?

                    <span>Any crossover between Niantic AR gaming and Cardano?
 Niantic, well known as the creator of Pokémon Go, is pressing on into the metaverse. But they are seemingly late, and they&#x27;re trying to change the narrative from one in which the metaverse is something detached from reality to one in which the metaverse interacts with the real world (remember that Niantic is first and foremost and augmented reality game designer).
 I wonder whether Niantic might, as they scramble to catch up (or change narratives), might be open to joining forces with an open, public blockchain, and building an infrastructure.
 Pokémon Go has always been about artifacts of varying rarity that people show off, trade, and (despite Niantic&#x27;s best efforts to design around and squelch it) buy and sell in some fashion. Seems a natural fit for NFTs, and I imagine Niantic would be more open to an open marketplace if the contracts attached to their NFTs specified that they get a small cut - which you can do with Cardano. Identity is also a challenge (can I trust this person I am trading or raiding with?), and I imagine self-sovereign identity systems might be useful here.
 All of this is pretty obvious. But Niantic is, as noted, catching up. Maybe they are in a more pliable and open state than usual?
 It would be nice to have a major gaming outfit onboard with Cardano.

                    <span>I have been staking ADA since the start. I have always done my research to find a pool that I find has a good purpose, along with good rewards because who doesn&#x27;t like high rewards? 
 I have found that no matter the pool, if the rewards are predicted to be in the 4-5% range, the most I have averaged is around 2.5%. I realize the 4-5% isn&#x27;t guaranteed but Ive staked a few pools now over a year and neither has been over 2.5% rewards and they are still advertising an average of 4-5% depending on the pool. 
 Anybody else ?

                    <span>When ERC-20 converter will be fully realeased, could you have USDT on cardano? By my understanding everything that is erc-20 could be transfered on to cardano chain. 
 So then Yes?

                    <span>Hi,
 in the advent of smart contracts I wonder if it is possible to build the equivalent of a giro account with improved customer rights:
 Joe user (~70 yrs) is used to pay/withdraw via card and can handle a smart phone. Since he recently lost his card and once it got stolen, he does not want to be solely responsible of keeping the secret keys to his possessions.
 That&#x27;s why he is registering at an entities offering a &quot;defi bank service&quot;.
 &quot;defi bank service&quot; offers the following:
  
Opening of a &quot;defi bank account&quot; -- registration via DID -- issuance of a smart contract involving --- Joe --- defi bank service --- attorney --- heir
 
Deposit: Joe/attorney get addresses where they can deposit funds
 
Service: offers support to Joe on how to use the &quot;defi bank service&quot;
 
Closing of a &quot;defi b…</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone.
 I&#x27;ve been holding some ADA for over a year now and have not staked it. That being said, I am ready to stake my ADA for the long run.
 I&#x27;ve read a few posts suggesting that you should stake in larger pools because it doesn&#x27;t help with decentralization? that being said, I&#x27;m looking to join a staking pool and don&#x27;t know where to start.
 thanks for your help!

                    <span>We have seen that dexes seem to need to kind of workaround (scoopers, matchmakers, etc) on eUTXO so I assume the accounts model is somewhat better suited for this use case (or am I wrong?). But what are other CONCRETE use cases where eUTXO really shines?

 Hey Everyone!
 Let&#x27;s go...
 Newly covered today:
  
Rick McCracken makes a great point about Cardano Stake pools losing $0 of delegator money in 2021 while ETH stakepools have apparently lost at least $163 Million. https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1468819811014610945
 There was an AMA about AVOUM on the IOHK discord on 12/09/21. AVOUM would allow for account balance type smart contracts (e.g. as in ETH) on top of the Cardano Blockchain. https://twitter.com/MutualKnowledge/status/1468711769069789196
 It appears that the number of Plutus scripts running on the Cardano blockchain has more than doubled in the last month. https://twitter.com/CardanoStiftung/status/1468645270221033475/photo/1
 Unbelievably, we’re seeing reports that Solana “crashed” again. Another report is chalking…</span>

                    <span>i’ve been holding ADA for over a year now on coinbase and have always wanted to stake but could never commit to it because of fear! i finally got my hands on a trezor model t and it took me a couple days to even open it and get it preinitialized. today i set it up, linked it to a new yoroi wallet and it has been going very smoothly! i sent a few test transactions between yoroi and coinbase (send and receive) and staked only 0.25% of my total ada lol. im scared! did i choose the right stake pool?? i’m staking on BCSH (blue cheese stake house) as its one of the sundaeswap pools and want to contribute to the development but i’m scared to fully commit. what should i do?? thanks guys hopefully i don’t come off as a pusspop

                    <span>Seems like I would be violating the cardinal rule: never share your seed phrase. My Daedalus wallet isn’t loaded often enough to function properly. Seems like Yoroi would be a better choice if I’m only checking it every week/month. 
 What is the process to load my coins onto Yoroi? I don’t even know if my computer could load Daedalus at this point so I’m not even gonna try unless I have to. Do I need a seed phrase? Do I input my ledger seed phrase? That just seems dodgy as hell and even if people suggest this I’m not going to do it and I’ll have to find a different solution. If I load Yoroi as a Chrome extension, will it prompt me to connect a hardware wallet which will automatically load my coins?
 Also, I started out simply enough with just buying on an exchange and staking my coins. Now I’m messing around beyond my pay grade; concentrated liquidity positions, bridging assets between chains, connecting my MetaMask to various Dapps and smart contracts, etc. I use my computer for personal use and crypto shit. Is this a horrible idea as long as I’m connected to a hardware wallet? 
 Sorry for all the noob questions but I figured I might as well ask here as I need to access Yoroi and the community as a whole has been quite helpful. Thanks!

                    <span>Canadian noob ADA holder here. I own 100 ADA on a platform called Wealthsimple and they’re coming soon with a feature to transfer crypto out into a wallet.
 I like holding on an exchange because it’s so simple and I’m a beginner in the crypto space (aside from my ADA my only other exposure to crypto is that I hold a small position in a specific Canadian blockchain company that mines BTC and ETH). 
 My question is how much more advantageous would it be for me to transfer into my own wallet than to keep on an exchange? I’m trying to look at all the variables before I make a decision and thought this would be a good place to inquire.

                    <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce that the second release candidate for upcoming text-2.0 with UTF-8 underlying representation has been just uploaded on Hackage: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate
 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate/changelog
 Please give it a try. Here is a cabal.project template: https://gist.github.com/Bodigrim/9834568f075be36a1c65e7aaba6a15db
 What&#x27;s changed between rc1 and rc2?
 head.hackage has been updated to text-2.0, which helped to find and fix several bugs and regressions.
 What&#x27;s next?
 If no critical issues are identified in the next week or two, the final release of text-2.0 will follow shortly.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve started working on performance of the venerable but somewhat neglected pqueue package. The changes I&#x27;ve made so far are pretty obviously good, and make a big difference in even the most informal testing. But to make decisions about smaller points, I really need benchmarks, and the package has none. Does anyone know of a benchmark suite for priority queues? One that includes algorithms that involve persistent queue use would be particularly desirable, but I&#x27;ll take anything.

                    <span>I was musing about the following:
  
Would a language version*, where &#x27;in the case of a newtype everything (that&#x27;s derivable, including with language extensions, like GeneralizedNewTypeDeriving) is automatically derived, unless a manual derivation or a manual instance is defined (or manually suppressed, with a new syntax)&#x27; be more ergonomic?
  
I was thinking about this, because I noticed that with quick problems I was often reaching for type instead of newtype. The latter would afford more type safety, but even manually adding the relevant deriving ... clauses felt like a chore for the Advent of Code problems.
  
*) I don&#x27;t pretend that would still necessarily fall under Haskell2010 + a new extension; maybe this would need to be a hypothetical Haskell derivative, because of semantic changes down the line.
  
Would this even be viable? Would there be undesirable consequences? Would it indeed improve ergonomics, or was that stray thought just a wrong impression?

                    <span>Hi haskellers. I was installing haskell on my distro, I saw a package called haskell-language-server. I searched a lot on internet, but I want an easy explaination of language-server and haskell-language-server in simple words. If you can also explain it layman&#x27;s term, it would be very helpful, hopefully. I appreciate your help.

                    <span>Taking a shower is a fucking scam. Eating food during the day is a psyop. Brushing your teeth is propaganda. Having sex is complete garbage from the condom industry. Playing games or sports is trash. Having a kid is made up. &quot;Taking a nap&quot; lol what the fuck. Cleaning your house is woke poisoned. Why are you forced to hear a bird in the morning. Having friends is just some shit created by the ad agencies. Feeling happy/sad/afraid/mad/etc. is fake rubbish. Talking to someone is r-slurred

                    <span>I&#x27;ve my Cardano on Yoroi, and recently I got a Ledger Nano X and I would like to move my Cardano there. 
 The thing is I have my Cardano delegated to a stake pool, and I would like to know if it&#x27;s possible to move my Cardano to Ledger, connect my Ledger to Yoroi and keep my Cardano delegated without actually leaving the stake pool? 
 I know I can leave the stake pool and then delegate my Cardano again, but if I do that I will have to wait 2 weeks (I think) again before I continue receiving the rewards.

                    <span>Just to qualify myself, my biggest investment is in ADA. I hold a substantial amount and I would like nothing more than to see everything succeed that is tied to it. But the sundae testnet so far has been very discouraging. I first jumped in on Monday, Dec 6 when it was launched. Nothing worked for me. And there were many UI bugs that should have been fixed prior to a network scalability test (which is what I assume is the main reason to test on public testnet). Today, four days later, I came back to take another shot. Some things have been improved but still seeing many errors and have not seen a successful swap occur. The swap delay is concerning as that enforces the narrative on Cardano not able to handle concurrency. So I asked myself, would I swap or add liquidity on sundae if it was in mainnet today or next week. No. Really looking forward to Hydra, P2P networking and anything else that can improve scalability 
 Would you trade on sundae today or next week? What is your experience? Lets be completely honest

 I would like to know if anyone has any good experience with ADA games and i don&#x27;t mean only from a profit perspective but also from a fun perspective?
 From my initial search it seems there are already some on the ecosystem, but i was looking for feedback that would help me not having to try them all.
 Thank you.

                    <span>I bought a ledger lately, but failed to sync it with my existing wallet. 
 I know I could make a new wallet but it mean paying the staking fee once again &amp; waiting for 3 epochs... No big deal but if there is a way to avoid that, I would be glad to use it :)

 It&#x27;s an amazing initiative, and I&#x27;m happy to see the extra rewards donated to help with climate change.
 ​
 Derrick talks about how much reforestation can impact global climate change and how their approach helps the environment and local social development.
 ​
 Stephen describes what the Veritree Token is and what the redeemable NFT might look like. They&#x27;re collaborating with other Cardano community members to have these created for their distribution event.
 ​
 Jeremy talks about the Global Challenge, how Cardano is being used to record and track the data, and how other NGOs are looking at the model to create change in the future.

                    <span>I’m very new when it comes to this stuff. Setting up Daedalus and choosing a stake pool was easy enough but how much more technical knowledge do I need to get involved with Sundaeswap?
 I want to do this for the airdropped Sundaeswap tokens and to delve a bit deeper into the Cardano ecosystem. AFAIK I need to download Nami? Then choose from a list of preselected stake pools who qualified for the ISO? Then I could also contribute to certain LP’s for additional airdropped tokens? Is this right? Did I miss the cutoff date? 
 Is there anything I should be aware of that I’m missing? People said to wait for Yoroi to deploy but what is the benefit of this? Sorry if these are very dumb questions. I’m kind of just figuring this out as I go along. Thanks!

                    <span>So, working on a project I noticed that the minimum balance associated to any UTXO is 1 ADA. So when forming a transaction, there MUST be a --tx-out with a minimum of 1ADA returned as change, stopping you from &quot;zero&#x27;ing out&quot; a UTXO.
 Is there a reason for this? I haven&#x27;t tried it, but, theoretically, that means you have (adaRate * (UTXO:walletAddress)) remaining in an address, which would suck because you&#x27;re essentially saying if you process hundreds or even thousands of transactions on an address, there must be 1ADA left for each UTXO?
 Or if I were to try to transfer all the UTXO balances out, (--tx-in all of the UTXOs) as long as one remains with 1ADA that would be sufficient?
 I can write some of this today, it just sucks that you could possibly have hundreds if not thousands of dollars (ada * market rate) tied up in loose UTXOs.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m a dev interested in the potential of building games on Cardano, and I was wondering if anyone has any readings, discussion, or information they&#x27;d be willing to share on the topic. The scope of this question is rather large, and intentionally so!
 Where should one begin if they wanted to build something like CryptoKitties with Cardano?
 Any information or discussion at all is appreciated.

                    <span>So I&#x27;m trying to implement a caesar cypher (see below). I have a function (caesar) that shifts right, e.g. caesar 1 &quot;abc&quot; would result in &quot;bcd&quot;, that works as intended. Now I was thinking to shift that to the left, I&#x27;d just have to adjust the the shift functions a little, but my current implementation doesn&#x27;t work around the edges, e.g. unCaesar 1 &quot;abc&quot; results in &quot;baz&quot; (?!) . I would love an explanation on why the shiftLeft functions behave like they do :)
 import Data.Char caesar :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; String caesar _ [] &#x3D; [] caesar n (x:xs) &#x3D; shiftRight n x : caesar n xs unCaesar :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; String unCaesar _ [] &#x3D; [] unCaesar n (x:xs) &#x3D; shiftLeft n x : unCaesar n xs shiftRight :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftRight a b | isUpper b &#x3D; shiftRightUpper a b | isLower b &#x3D; shiftRightLower a b | otherwise &#x3D; b shiftLeft :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftLeft a b | isUpper b &#x3D; shiftLeftUpper a b | isLower b &#x3D; shiftLeftLower a b | otherwise &#x3D; b shiftRightLower :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftRightLower a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a + (ord b - ord &#x27;a&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;a&#x27; shiftRightUpper :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftRightUpper a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a + (ord b - ord &#x27;A&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;A&#x27; shiftLeftLower :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char -- doesn&#x27;t work yet shiftLeftLower a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a - (ord b - ord &#x27;a&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;a&#x27; shiftLeftUpper :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char -- doesn&#x27;t work either shiftLeftUpper a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a - (ord b - ord &#x27;A&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;A&#x27;

                    <span>I tried to solve Day 9, part one with algebraic graphs, a library I wanted to try out for a long time. I eventually failed, because my approach (build graph -&gt; remove all vertices that have a lower neighbour -&gt; count the value of the remaining vertices) relies on neighbours :: Ord a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Graph a -&gt; Set a, which has an inefficient implementation (folds the whole graph, hence my algorithm is at least quadratic.) It still works for the example input tho! :)
 I would be glad about answer or general feedback about the my solution:
 -- I seem to need some kind of indexing, otherwise there is no way to distinguish vertexes. -- Question 1: Is there a smarter way to do it? -- 1 2 &#x3D;&gt; neighbours (vertex 1) will look for both 1&#x27;s ((0,0), 1) ((0,1), 2) &#x3D;&gt; Works, but ugly -- 3 1 ((1,0), 3) ((1,1), 1) type Cell &#x3D; ((Int, Int), Int) indexLines :: [[(Int, Int)]] -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [[Cell]] indexLines (i : is) (inf : infs) &#x3D; fmap (\(x, v) -&gt; ((inf, x), v)) i : indexLines is infs indexLines [] _ &#x3D; [] -- I construct the input grid as follows: Construct row1 and row2, overlay them, construct row 2 and row 3, overlay the whole thing etc. -- Question 2: Is there a more elegant way to construct a grid? constructGraphFromInput :: [[Cell]] -&gt; ([Cell], Graph Cell) constructGraphFromInput [] &#x3D; error &quot;Should not happen!&quot; constructGraphFromInput (cs : css) &#x3D; foldl (\(cs_last, acc) cs_cur -&gt; (cs_cur, overlay (addLines cs_last cs_cur) acc)) (cs, empty) css where addLines :: [Cell] -&gt; [Cell] -&gt; Graph Cell addLines u l &#x3D; overlays $ path u : path l : zipWith edge u l solve :: String -&gt; IO () solve s &#x3D; do fileInput  lines fileInput let indexedLines &#x3D; indexLines indexedRows [0 ..] let (_, grid) &#x3D; constructGraphFromInput indexedLines let onlyLowestPoints &#x3D; induce (\v -&gt; snd v  vertexList onlyLowestPoints

                    <span>Looking at the following syntax:
 getValues x1 &#x3D; do
 g &lt;- get
 let name &#x3D; &quot;aName&quot;
 return [Map.lookup x1 (myMap g)]
 ​
  
Does &lt;- get set g to the output of the return line? If not, what does g &lt;- get do?
 x1 appears to be the key to a map lookup, and myMap g is the map, but what is the relationship between the g in myMap g and the g in g &lt;- get. Recursive? There is no g as an argument to getValues.

                    <span>The stereotype is that only Senior Haskellers get hired. Perhaps it’s best to just ask any lurkers if their company actually hires and mentors Junior devs and is actively seeking them today. 
 So, who’s hiring Junior devs?

                    <span>As a financial services professional without developer skills I am very excited to see Marlowe get released. I think the utility and use case potential can really open the door on Cardano becoming mainstream in financial services.
 If any of the tech savvy Plutus/Marlowe folks in the community have good insights for a non-coder like me, please let me know.

Charles dropped a new AMA! https://youtu.be/Jex6wItSvzE
 In macro news that could affect all of crypto including Cardano, it looks like Evergrande (one of the largest real estate developers in the world) has finally formally defaulted on its debt obligations. While Evergrand has been stumbling for a long time, this event could mark the beginning of a new phase in global economics. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/china-evergrande-kaisa-property.html https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/evergrande-set-for-restructuring-with-no-word-on-first-formal-default.html

                    <span>Hey there, 
 I need your guys help. A friend of mine, who will get a dad soon, is a fan of cardano. So i&#x27;ve decided to gift him a which wallet, which stakes and can be forgotten for years. 
 My plan was to just sent ADA to the wallet, choose a staking pool through Daedalus or a other wallet, delete the software and gift him the private key. In 10 or 15 years he could use the money for his child. 
 But ive red that staking pools vary on payout ratio, depending on how many people use it. 
 Actually im fine with the APR going up and down a bit. Market should rule that right?
 But is it possible that a staking pool gets taken down? What happens then? Do you have suggestions to make this gift work?
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>With all the optimisation and now Sundae Swap stress testing the test net. Prior to the release of Hydra what kind of TPS can we expect? Granted testnet and main net are different, so shall I rephrase the question: now that some optimisation has been done on the main net what TPS should we expect?

                    <span>This has probably been thought of before, and there may already devs working on something like this, could you use NFTs for event tickets and build in an anti scalping system into a smart contract. For example, the mint price being the price of the ticket, if the ticket is resold, any amount over the mint price goes to the artist/venue. Or could the smart contract limit the resale price to the mint price. This would essentially make scalping pointless.

                    <span>This is late, but I took a closer listen to Charles Hoskinson&#x27;s video On DApps. It was released December 2nd, 2021. So it happened before the Sundae Swap testnet. It really would have been nice to get Charles thoughts on the testnet, but I suspect he&#x27;s thinking so long-term, he&#x27;s not that concerned about anyone particular DApp. 
 Key points:
  
dApp certification is under development, targeting 2022 release. Idea is to have 4 levels of certification for apps on the dApps store in a light wallet: [Uncertified, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3]. Apps in the dApp store will have their certification level as meta-data that the end-user can view.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve never used a Dex and am relatively new to Defi, but as I lean more about how these Dexs work they don&#x27;t seem to be decentralized at all. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but it seems you need to use a centralized Web interface, controlled entirely by the team that produced it. They do the swaps off-chain (e.g. using a &quot;scooper&quot; on SundaeSwap), and then the final transactions are batched and recorded on the blockchain. So, it seems Cardano is only involved in the settlement process, not in the swap process.
 I envisioned a swap smart contract that accepted buy- and sell-order transactions, matched them up, and did the swap and settlement all autonomously. Users could submit these transactions using their wallet or the Cardano CLI. After the smart contract was published, the team that developed it could dissolve and the smart contract would remain and run indefinitely.
 Is the current centralization and dependency on a 3rd party team like SundaeSwap Labs just temporary while we wait for Hydra or other technologies on the Cardano network to be developed, or am I expecting too much?

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking through the blockfrost api and the googles and am not finding what I’m looking for. I was hoping to be able to pass in &#x60;walletAddress&#x60; and &#x60;policyId&#x60; and have it return assets from that policy that are owned by that wallet. 
 Here&#x27;s an example of someone else doing it for Hosky: https://rudigus.github.io/hority/?wallet&#x3D;addr1v86kueglt6y5au9nvpa85ytu8qfjqldjh4gptvfu4qnacrsqsfy2w 
 By the way, I&#x27;m going to use &#x60;blockfrost-js&#x60; for this. 
 Thanks!

                    <span>🗞️ While our native smart contract language Plutus is in the news at the moment, through 2021, we’ve been collaborating with MuKn on bringing their DSL (domain-specific language) to Cardano as part of our mission to extend developer choice. 
 💡AVOUM is a technology that enables contracts to be written and used as per the account model made famous by Ethereum, on top of a blockchain built on the UTXO model like Cardano. 
 🗓️ Tomorrow (December 9th) at 4pm UTC, François-René will share insight into AVOUM and the technicalities of the project on our Discord Stage.

                    <span>On behalf of maintainers I&#x27;m happy to announce that bytestring-0.11.2.0 is finally released.
 Highlights from the changelog:
  
New functions: 
 ultra-fast SIMD-based isValidUtf8 validator,
 foldr&#x27;, foldr1&#x27;, scanl1, scanr, scanr1, takeEnd, dropEnd, takeWhileEnd, dropWhileEnd, spanEnd, breakEnd for lazy ByteString,
 writeFile to dump Builder directly,
 fromFilePath and toFilePath for locale-aware conversions.
 
 Performance improvements: 
 speed up floatDec and doubleDec up to 10x using Ryu algorithm,
 new SIMD-based count is up to 5x faster,
 improve inlining of foldl, foldl&#x27;, foldr, foldr&#x27;, mapAccumL, mapAccumR, scanl, scanr and filter,
 faster internal loop in unfoldrN,
 use a static lookup table for Base16 Builders.
 
 Add Lift instances for ByteString and ShortByteString.
 Put HasCallStack constraints onto partial functions.
  
Many people contributed their time and effort to make this release happen. Just to name a few in no particular order, mostly according to git log:

                    <span>I am trying to write an IO action that bugs the user to enter a number within a certain range.
 Since the user is entering the number from the keyboard, I have to allow the possibility that
 the user types in something that cannot be converted into an Int value.
 ​
 This is what I have so far
 ​
 action2 :: Int -&gt; IO Int
 action2 n &#x3D; do
 putStrLn &quot;\nEnter action2 ...&quot;
 ​
 let m &#x3D; 2 * n 
 ​
 putStrLn $ &quot;n &#x3D; &quot; ++ (show n)
 putStrLn &quot;... leave action2\n&quot;

                    <span>If I were a teacher of high-schoolers wanting to connect some underlying theory to Haskell, could I explain Haskell list comprehensions as basically just a Cartesian/cross product machine? Would this be accurate? And then the combinatorics product rule also seems at play here. I would appreciate any theoretical explanation of what a list comprehension is about.
 Edit: Looking at the Report I can see and understand the details, but somehow that list of facts in the &quot;Translations&quot; box implies, results in the Cartesian product. I&#x27;d like to know how and why.
 Edit 2.0: I guess I&#x27;m just trying to fathom what exactly a list comprehension is. The obvious answer is it&#x27;s supposed to be some sort of set comprehension. But if a standard use of it is like this
 [(x,y) | x&lt;-xs, y&lt;-ys] 
 producing the Cartesian product, then it&#x27;s obvious the Cartesian product is built into this thing, i.e., that Haskell Report description is creating a Cartesian product machine with the ability to ad lib seeming non-binary relation Cartesian things when we want. So even if I do this
 [x+x | x&lt;-[2]] [4] 
 I&#x27;m still using (or bypassing most of) that same inherent Cartesian product mechanism. This gets silly
 [x+y | x&lt;-[1..10], y&lt;-[1..10], x &#x3D;&#x3D; y, x &#x3D;&#x3D; 2] [4] 
 but yes, this is a Cartesian &quot;all possible combinations&quot; product, which is then filtered. If I&#x27;m right, this is marvelous, i.e., a &quot;generalized&quot; Cartesian product algorithm-thingy.

                    <span>SundaeSwap DEX runs on Cardano test-net. We bring you a tutorial on how to try out the token swap. We&#x27;ll show you how to prepare a Nami wallet (without HW wallet support), connect it to the SundaeSwap test-net and do a simple swap of tokens.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a lot of Dexes besides SundaeSwap that did their own testnet way back and barely talked about in this subreddit. Even though it wasn&#x27;t the testnet phase, I haven&#x27;t seen any post talking about any other Dexes that might go live first than SundaeSwap or any other topic regarding any of them. Is it because SundaeSwap&#x27;s marketing team is good or is it just because Charles supports this project?
 Edit: I saw people asking what are the other dexes. Besides SundaeSwap, there&#x27;s Minswap, Maladex, Cardax, Ardana, Ergodex (but I&#x27;ve seen a few post regariding this dex in the past), Matrixswap, and Mirquir. I dunno If I missed one. All I know is Minswap is already done with their testnet but not sure about the other dexes.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying understand the rationale, I thought this community is one of the most mature one out there but it got me thinking as to why everyone&#x27;s been saying SundaeSwap was the first? Even on other social medias SundaeSwap is hailed as &quot;first&quot; and only few people are commenting that MuesliSwap was actually first
 Can someone explain me why SundaeSwap is first when it&#x27;s in testnet and MuesliSwap was on the mainnet? Forgive my ignorance

                    <span>Hey Everyone!
 Let&#x27;s go...
 Newly covered today:
  
SundaeSwap went live on testnet with a faucet for free testnet ADA and various ice cream flavored free testnet tokens. All compatible with Nami. https://twitter.com/SundaeSwap/status/1467795614633185280
 ADA Handles were a surprise integration into the SundaeSwap Testnet! https://twitter.com/adahandle/status/1467907015972323328
 The testnet proved valuable quickly as some improvements were identified with the scooper and they were taken offline to make those changes. https://twitter.com/SundaeSwap/status/1467897465768665090
 Here is a beautiful illustration of massive concurrency in action on Cardano’s testnet! https://twitter.com/ProfSmith9000/status/1467978254912946184/photo/1

 Starting at 22:30
 The one thing I want for Christmas is for everyone to start getting along in our industry. It&#x27;s extraordinary to me that when people are so close in philosophy and viewpoint, and in some cases technology, they can be so far apart as people. It&#x27;s extraordinary.
 You don&#x27;t see this in other industries. You don&#x27;t see in physics or biology, or cellphone manufacturing, or whatever, pick an industry, the amount of tribalism, hate, and vitriol that our industry has for each other. And as long as we&#x27;re doing that to each other, there&#x27;s no reality where we&#x27;re ever going to be able to overcome the real enemy, which is the legacy systems that hold three billion people and the human race down, destroy our environment, and divide us in ways that make us hate people we&#x27;ve never met and should never have grievances against.
 That has to stop. And the only way it&#x27;s going to stop is if we get better systems that are more fair. And the only way we do that, is we have to work together. So, we&#x27;ll see, 2022 whether that&#x27;s accomplished. People will still try to divide us. Books will be published. Podcasters will say things. Reddit and Twitter will continue to pour rivers of verbal diarrhea. But it&#x27;s up to each and every one of us to transcend that, step above it, and realize that we have a finite window.

                    <span>Someone asked about IELE during the AMA and Charles said he thinks we&#x27;ll have an end of year update on IELE from Runtime Verification (RV) so he didn&#x27;t want to front run that but that RV has made an enormous amount of progress this year. He said Cardano is bringing the IELE testnet with Mamba and there will be an IELE sidechain with Mamba coming to Cardano in 2022. They are targeting C and C++.

                    <span>I am a Blockchain Master student (not a Dev though) who went through an incubation program for my DApp idea that is to tackle the poor postal infrastructure in the Global South, particularly Africa. I also got a fast grant of 30k from NEAR Protocol pitching them my idea. My plan now is to get a team together and start building on several BCs among them Cardano as its vision with respect to Africa is highly complementary. Also, the Catalyst program for initial funding could be the next step. At the end out of this DApp idea a DAO shall be established over time. Feel free to reach out if you want to build a DApp with a real world use case.

                    <span>Cardano DID method
 Preamble
 This post is regarding a draft Decentralised ID (DID) method for the Cardano Blockchain. I would love to hear people&#x27;s feedback on how it can be improved!
 You can also check out the github for the idea and propose changes directly and keep up to date with alterations.
 Introduction
 Cardano is a public blockchain platform. It is open-source and decentralized, with consensus achieved using proof of stake. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its internal cryptocurrency, Ada. Cardano DID method is a proposed implementation of Decentralised ID (DID) for the Cardano Blockchain and provides a concrete specification for Cardano-specific DID. This method is valid for both the Cardano mainnet and testnet.

                    <span>I&#x27;m new to learning about Cardano. I&#x27;ve got a question about the interaction between native tokens and smart contracts - how can conditions be imposed on the transfer of tokens on Cardano?
 On Ethereum for example we know any token that isn&#x27;t ether is a second class citizen and requires interaction with a smart contract to do anything. We know this has all sorts of disadvantages and introduces an overhead in terms of computation required on the EVM.
 But one advantage is that whilst settlement itself is computationally more intensive than needed, it would be very natural to impose conditions on the terms of settlement since that just requires augmenting the smart contract that already necessarily exists.
 How can conditions be imposed on Cardano when tokens are native citizens? Is there an elegant way to force the owner of a token to interact with a smart contract (and the computation layer) before settlement? 
 Conceptually speaking, I would imagine the way to do this is to impose datums on every UTXO, then having that self-propagate onto the next UTXO when the transaction is built. But can this be codified at the time of minting? Because my understanding of the resources I&#x27;ve read so far only mentions minting policy, which seems to only concern things like minting and burning.
 Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m issuing tokens that contain the hashes for something that should be non-transferrable - a university degree, or some form of identification. On Ethereum I could simply write into the smart contract conditions to prevent me from sending the ERC-721 token out of my account. How can this be done on Cardano, and when and where would I need to enumerate these conditions?

                    <span>Again, following through the tutorial found at 
 https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/listening-for-payments-cli
 I realized that this is a simple example (but of course it is), for listening for a single payment. But what in the instance of multiple payments for the same product?
 For example: If you have a product that you want to sell, say for 1 ADA (1,000,000 Lovelace), once you receive that, your rawUTXOTable (in this example) would always be positive...meaning if anyone else came along and bought that same product, listening for it would always say the purchase has been made.
 Now, I get it. A more complicated transaction would need to happen with metadata...but seems short sighted to not build the tutorial for this portion?
 ...I mean theoretically you could always add the UTXO you received initially to a list to avoid, but that only restricts you in one manner...*meh*

 then I try this and get
 myNat 
 Exception: arithmetic underflow
 no different from just
 -1 :: Natural 
 Exception: arithmetic underflow
 With the first equating Haskell seems to wait until I call myNat to say something, and then it gives what seems a cryptic error message. What&#x27;s going on under the hood here?

                    <span>I know it&#x27;s likely a silly sentiment, however, today marks my first ever passive reward for staking with Cardano, and I&#x27;m over the moon! 
 I&#x27;ve already invested around 4 times more than my initial staking, and I don&#x27;t plan to stop anytime soon.
 It seems like a picked a crazy time to join the community, but since joining I&#x27;ve already learned a lot, and I cannot wait to see where this journey takes me!
 Here&#x27;s to all those investing in themselves and the future!

                    <span>I didn&#x27;t see this question asked here so would like to know.
 I am not an expert on SundaeSwap. This is what I got from the SundawSwap post on here.

                    <span>Hello all, I just wanted to introduce myself to the community. I am new to Cardano, not to crypto. I used this current dip to buy in and though its not what most would say a lot. It is what I wanted to put in at this moment. I do will be creeping around on here to learn more about the project and to keep updated. 
 ​
 I thank all in advance for any welcomes. If they are F@ck off replies then FU2. hahaha. I hope all have a great day!

                    <span>There is a fun &quot;game&quot; emerging on the Cardano blockchain, which will soon be played by matchmakers on MuesliSwap and by Scoopers on SundaySwap etc. Here is a simplified version of the game, useful for thinking about optimal strategies:
 The game: 
 Imagine there are 10 prices: $1, $2, $3, ..., $10. There are also 100 players. The game is simple: each player writes down which prize they want, without looking at other people&#x27;s entry. Then, the players simply receive the price they wrote down! However, if multiple people write down the same prize, the price is given randomly to one of the people who wanted it. Which prize would you choose? You might instantly want to pick $10, but if many people think like that, the chances of getting this prize is low, leading to a low expected (or average) …</span>

                    <span>Before attempting to try the testnet please add Collateral on your NAMI Wallet and make sure it’s on Testnet and not Mainnet! This will allow your wallet to actually interact with the DEX test, otherwise you’ll be stuck with pending transactions forever. 
 Good luck!

                    <span>I thought I would update everyone not sitting in Discord on the Developer&#x27;s feedback. Overall, they see it as a success so far. There are issues with the scoopers which is causing a transaction backlog. That seems to be the big issue. They&#x27;ve had to bring them down while the work out the bugs (so the backlog will continue). But no issues with the Cardano network/protocol! Only with the scoopers and UI:

                    <span>I know that Muesliswap is not very well-liked by a big part of the community because they have no audits and anon team. However I just swapped some tokens (WMT-ADA) on Muesliswap and I have to say that it works smoothly and it feels really cool to do some actual DeFi on Cardano! I would say that even if you&#x27;re skeptical about the project, it is fun to try it with a small amount of tokens!

                    <span>SundaeSwap Flavours
 First of all - sry for my bad englisch and my semi good understanding of od DEX and sundaeswap in special. Im really into Ada and try to participate in new projects like sundaeswap and right now im on the Testnet to get familiar wirh the upcoming mainnet… i have a small understanding what a dex is and what liquiditiy pools are for - but what i don’t understand is, why are there different types sundaeswap tokens? like choc, mint, sberry, rberry? what is the different between them and what is the difference in their value? if i pair choc and ada to a pool - why could this be better or worse compared to ada - rberry?
 hope you guys can help me out - i really dont get this 😬 Thx

                    <span>Keen to hear members’ thoughts on the Cardano Foundation. 
 It often feels like IOG does the lion’s share of heavy lifting when it comes to active communication and promotion of Cardano’s capability and strengths. I had renewed hopes for the system’s adoption strategy and marketing following the overhaul of the Foundation in late 2020. 
 Maybe I’m missing something or not looking in the right places? 
 Keen to hear the Foundation’s views also.
 Thanks all, be well.

                    <span>Just a few brief comments, some of our engineers worked with the sundae team to help optimize some of their scripts. We&#x27;ve been trying to extend this help to many DEXes and applications in the ecosystem.
 It&#x27;s very important to understand that developing on Cardano is a new experience for the vast majority of the community and it will require some time for projects to fully understand, become productive, and deliver their DApps. The point of testnets are to provide early adopters and software developers a chance to iron out many issues that could impact quality, security, or user experience. Thus, by defintion, issues are expected, bugs should be encountered, and delays will happen. It&#x27;s part of the process and I&#x27;m sure tbe team is hard at work chipping away at these things.

                    <span>could use some guidance. If I want to buy ADA on coinbase, Is it unsafe to keep it on coinbase? Do I have to have a separate wallet? This would be my first crypto investment and although I did read some of the DD here… i feel like it got MORE confusing. Can I treat coinbase like any other brokerage and just keep my coins there?

                    <span>First of all, set your Nami wallet to testnet.

 ​
 Second, set your colateral otherwise you won&#x27;t be able to do anything
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/i8a3gg8y1x381.png?width&#x3D;744&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;90e40f112191afba3e6acb0d890596c4031a300c
 ​
 This thing will ask your password, default colateral is 5 tAda.
 ​
 Enter in the faucet and ask some tAda
 https://testnets.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/tools/faucet/
 If you want some of mine test net tokens I created a project in nft maker pro testnet so you just need to send tAda to these address in the exact amounts
 CheffTestnet 17 tAda &#x3D; 1,000,000
 addr_test1vqj0fj4rzhzasnngadrktn0ulsr9v2qdnmdscy67mstucms0m82kp
 HoskyTestnet 6,5 tAda &#x3D; 1,000,000
 addr_test1vzkmexszjlp7l9lvx0vpderuq2244dfshvncaxfarcu9mccca6fsv
 That&#x27;s it, you receive your tokens and you can add liquidity and do swaps!

                    <span>👋 Hey guys, so I&#x27;m fairly new to the whole Cardano developer ecosystem. I am currently learning solidity and its in and outs. I have recently began reading on the workings of cardano, its academic background and foundation and believe it has potential to be a great blockchain if not the best if more developers hop on board.
 So as a result I&#x27;m interested in learning how to develop cardano dapps, I know that Haskell is a non conditional prerequisite that one must learn to enter this space. What I would like to know is how much Lambda Calculus is truly need for me to know in order to create full functioning quality Dapps with Haskel. I will admit im not the strongest in math but I am capable of learning lambda if need be, I just need to know if it&#x27;s something I MUST know in order to be a functional cardano dev.
 ​
 thanks in advance for any responses.

 I have defined succ so that it can be applied to all permutation of [Letters] with a ordered sequence like this:
 succ [A,A,A] &#x3D; [A,A,B] succ [A,A,B] &#x3D; [A,A,C] succ [A,A,C] &#x3D; [A,B,A] ... succ [C,C,B] &#x3D; [C,C,C] -- succ [C,C,C] is not defined 
 build in Buildable is given the start and end value, it builds a ordered list of every element in the set including start and end:
 build A B &#x3D; [A,B] build B C &#x3D; [B,C] build A C &#x3D; [A,B,C] 
 ​
 How do I apply Buildable on [Letters] such that I can call build like this:
 build [A] [B] &#x3D; [[A],[B]] build [A,A] [B,B] &#x3D; [[A,A],[A,B],[B,A],[B,B]] build [A,A,A] [A,A,C] &#x3D; [[A,A,A],[A,A,B],[A,A,C]] build [B,B,C] [B,C,C] &#x3D; [[B,B,C],[B,C,A],[B,C,B],[B,C,C]] 
 It seems like I have to define what maxBound and minBound is for [Letters] if I do instance Buildable [a]. How do I do that?

                    <span>I want to get back into Haskell. I used it a lot a few years ago. I just installed haskell-platform on Ubuntu which seems to be the recommended download.
 Should I be using stack to make Haskell projects? stack wasn&#x27;t included in the haskell-platform download so is there a different workflow I should be using? I have some projects on github that I made with stack.
 Any help or other new advice would be nice
 ​
 Edit: Thaqnks for the installation advice, is there anything else new in Haskell worth knowing about?

Note: Because it touches the implementation, this post will be more technical than the others, and will also assume that you’re somewhat familiar with what content-addressed derivations means, and how it works.

                    <span>Recently, a group of Haskellers within Tweag had a knowledge-sharing event
where we shared our varied Haskell setups with each other, and learned some
nice tricks and tips for every-day life.
The idea was raised of sharing these findings via the blog, so without further
ado, let’s explore the varieties of the Tweag Haskelling experience by
covering a few of our personal setups!

                    <span>During my internship at Tweag, I worked on creating a
safe interface for the sparkle library under the excellent mentorship of Facundo
Domínguez. sparkle is a Haskell library that provides bindings for
Apache Spark using inline-java’s Java interop capabilities.
As such, this new safe interface accomplishes the same
thing that inline-java’s safe interface does; it helps to ensure safe
management of Java references at compile-time using linear types.
As discussed in this earlier post,
we need to be careful to free Java references provided by inline-java when they’re done
being used, and we also shouldn’t use them after they’ve been freed. Since sparkle
manipulates references to Java objects defined in the Spark Java library, any potential users
must take care to safely manage references when…</span>
