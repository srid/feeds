                    <span>Breakthrough.
 I&#x27;ve been grumbling here about ways in which Cardano DEXes seem too centralized, but at the same time freely admitting that I don&#x27;t fully understand how they work. I&#x27;ve been reading and seeking enlightenment. Most of the whitepapers for Maladex, Liqwid, SundaeSwap, etc. don&#x27;t quite tell me what I (and, judging from postings I see here, what others), need to know.
 I&#x27;m finally getting somewhere, though, and wanted to re-link to this video, posted to Reddit a week ago by u/lukasbradley, here, and add, for those like me who don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; Cardano DEXes, that the speaker being interviewed in that video provides a really lucid explanation of how things work - how the eUTxO model allows users to specify the conditions under which a particular contract executes, and puts those conditions right into the eUTxO, which is signed by the user. He talks, in an informal way that I personally &quot;get,&quot; about how the account, UTxO, and eUTxO models differ and what this means for software engineers like him.
 The key is that the eUTxO model allows for a finely-tuned, predictable, conditional execution by the DEX. You&#x27;re giving up a very precise amount of control to the DEX, and making it conditional.
 Quiz: When done, you should be able to explain how the owner, witness, datum, and redeemer all function in a Cardano eUTxO.
 I know everything said in that video has been said before, but that video somehow put things all together for me. Please, anyone still confused about the difference between building a DEX for an account, and an (e)UTxO, model, watch this. It&#x27;ll help.

                    <span>I am considering getting a team of fellow entrepreneurs together to build cardano&#x27;s first mobile decentralized application browser to compete with the Ethereum and layer 2 scaling ecosystems options. 
 There&#x27;s a handful of mobile decentralized application browsers today between Trust (Binance), Coinbase Wallet, Status, etc. but nothing like this exists for cardano&#x27;s current and coming applications yet.
 I think this will be highly important in the next wave of web3 adoption, including with a social application I already have in mind. 
 Is anyone in the community interested in this? If so, how important do you think it is?

                    <span>Any crossover between Niantic AR gaming and Cardano?
 Niantic, well known as the creator of Pokémon Go, is pressing on into the metaverse. But they are seemingly late, and they&#x27;re trying to change the narrative from one in which the metaverse is something detached from reality to one in which the metaverse interacts with the real world (remember that Niantic is first and foremost and augmented reality game designer).
 I wonder whether Niantic might, as they scramble to catch up (or change narratives), might be open to joining forces with an open, public blockchain, and building an infrastructure.
 Pokémon Go has always been about artifacts of varying rarity that people show off, trade, and (despite Niantic&#x27;s best efforts to design around and squelch it) buy and sell in some fashion. Seems a natural fit for NFTs, and I imagine Niantic would be more open to an open marketplace if the contracts attached to their NFTs specified that they get a small cut - which you can do with Cardano. Identity is also a challenge (can I trust this person I am trading or raiding with?), and I imagine self-sovereign identity systems might be useful here.
 All of this is pretty obvious. But Niantic is, as noted, catching up. Maybe they are in a more pliable and open state than usual?
 It would be nice to have a major gaming outfit onboard with Cardano.

                    <span>I have been staking ADA since the start. I have always done my research to find a pool that I find has a good purpose, along with good rewards because who doesn&#x27;t like high rewards? 
 I have found that no matter the pool, if the rewards are predicted to be in the 4-5% range, the most I have averaged is around 2.5%. I realize the 4-5% isn&#x27;t guaranteed but Ive staked a few pools now over a year and neither has been over 2.5% rewards and they are still advertising an average of 4-5% depending on the pool. 
 Anybody else ?

                    <span>When ERC-20 converter will be fully realeased, could you have USDT on cardano? By my understanding everything that is erc-20 could be transfered on to cardano chain. 
 So then Yes?

                    <span>Hi,
 in the advent of smart contracts I wonder if it is possible to build the equivalent of a giro account with improved customer rights:
 Joe user (~70 yrs) is used to pay/withdraw via card and can handle a smart phone. Since he recently lost his card and once it got stolen, he does not want to be solely responsible of keeping the secret keys to his possessions.
 That&#x27;s why he is registering at an entities offering a &quot;defi bank service&quot;.
 &quot;defi bank service&quot; offers the following:
  
Opening of a &quot;defi bank account&quot; -- registration via DID -- issuance of a smart contract involving --- Joe --- defi bank service --- attorney --- heir
 
Deposit: Joe/attorney get addresses where they can deposit funds
 
Service: offers support to Joe on how to use the &quot;defi bank service&quot;
 
Closing of a &quot;defi b…</span>

                    <span>Hello everyone.
 I&#x27;ve been holding some ADA for over a year now and have not staked it. That being said, I am ready to stake my ADA for the long run.
 I&#x27;ve read a few posts suggesting that you should stake in larger pools because it doesn&#x27;t help with decentralization? that being said, I&#x27;m looking to join a staking pool and don&#x27;t know where to start.
 thanks for your help!

                    <span>We have seen that dexes seem to need to kind of workaround (scoopers, matchmakers, etc) on eUTXO so I assume the accounts model is somewhat better suited for this use case (or am I wrong?). But what are other CONCRETE use cases where eUTXO really shines?

 Hey Everyone!
 Let&#x27;s go...
 Newly covered today:
  
Rick McCracken makes a great point about Cardano Stake pools losing $0 of delegator money in 2021 while ETH stakepools have apparently lost at least $163 Million. https://twitter.com/RichardMcCrackn/status/1468819811014610945
 There was an AMA about AVOUM on the IOHK discord on 12/09/21. AVOUM would allow for account balance type smart contracts (e.g. as in ETH) on top of the Cardano Blockchain. https://twitter.com/MutualKnowledge/status/1468711769069789196
 It appears that the number of Plutus scripts running on the Cardano blockchain has more than doubled in the last month. https://twitter.com/CardanoStiftung/status/1468645270221033475/photo/1
 Unbelievably, we’re seeing reports that Solana “crashed” again. Another report is chalking…</span>

                    <span>i’ve been holding ADA for over a year now on coinbase and have always wanted to stake but could never commit to it because of fear! i finally got my hands on a trezor model t and it took me a couple days to even open it and get it preinitialized. today i set it up, linked it to a new yoroi wallet and it has been going very smoothly! i sent a few test transactions between yoroi and coinbase (send and receive) and staked only 0.25% of my total ada lol. im scared! did i choose the right stake pool?? i’m staking on BCSH (blue cheese stake house) as its one of the sundaeswap pools and want to contribute to the development but i’m scared to fully commit. what should i do?? thanks guys hopefully i don’t come off as a pusspop

                    <span>Seems like I would be violating the cardinal rule: never share your seed phrase. My Daedalus wallet isn’t loaded often enough to function properly. Seems like Yoroi would be a better choice if I’m only checking it every week/month. 
 What is the process to load my coins onto Yoroi? I don’t even know if my computer could load Daedalus at this point so I’m not even gonna try unless I have to. Do I need a seed phrase? Do I input my ledger seed phrase? That just seems dodgy as hell and even if people suggest this I’m not going to do it and I’ll have to find a different solution. If I load Yoroi as a Chrome extension, will it prompt me to connect a hardware wallet which will automatically load my coins?
 Also, I started out simply enough with just buying on an exchange and staking my coins. Now I’m messing around beyond my pay grade; concentrated liquidity positions, bridging assets between chains, connecting my MetaMask to various Dapps and smart contracts, etc. I use my computer for personal use and crypto shit. Is this a horrible idea as long as I’m connected to a hardware wallet? 
 Sorry for all the noob questions but I figured I might as well ask here as I need to access Yoroi and the community as a whole has been quite helpful. Thanks!

                    <span>Canadian noob ADA holder here. I own 100 ADA on a platform called Wealthsimple and they’re coming soon with a feature to transfer crypto out into a wallet.
 I like holding on an exchange because it’s so simple and I’m a beginner in the crypto space (aside from my ADA my only other exposure to crypto is that I hold a small position in a specific Canadian blockchain company that mines BTC and ETH). 
 My question is how much more advantageous would it be for me to transfer into my own wallet than to keep on an exchange? I’m trying to look at all the variables before I make a decision and thought this would be a good place to inquire.

 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate/changelog
 Please give it a try. Here is a cabal.project template: https://gist.github.com/Bodigrim/9834568f075be36a1c65e7aaba6a15db
 What&#x27;s changed between rc1 and rc2?
 head.hackage has been updated to text-2.0, which helped to find and fix several bugs and regressions.
 What&#x27;s next?
 If no critical issues are identified in the next week or two, the final release of text-2.0 will follow shortly.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve started working on performance of the venerable but somewhat neglected pqueue package. The changes I&#x27;ve made so far are pretty obviously good, and make a big difference in even the most informal testing. But to make decisions about smaller points, I really need benchmarks, and the package has none. Does anyone know of a benchmark suite for priority queues? One that includes algorithms that involve persistent queue use would be particularly desirable, but I&#x27;ll take anything.

                    <span>I was musing about the following:
  
Would a language version*, where &#x27;in the case of a newtype everything (that&#x27;s derivable, including with language extensions, like GeneralizedNewTypeDeriving) is automatically derived, unless a manual derivation or a manual instance is defined (or manually suppressed, with a new syntax)&#x27; be more ergonomic?
  
I was thinking about this, because I noticed that with quick problems I was often reaching for type instead of newtype. The latter would afford more type safety, but even manually adding the relevant deriving ... clauses felt like a chore for the Advent of Code problems.
  
*) I don&#x27;t pretend that would still necessarily fall under Haskell2010 + a new extension; maybe this would need to be a hypothetical Haskell derivative, because of semantic changes down the line.
  
Would this even be viable? Would there be undesirable consequences? Would it indeed improve ergonomics, or was that stray thought just a wrong impression?

                    <span>Hi haskellers. I was installing haskell on my distro, I saw a package called haskell-language-server. I searched a lot on internet, but I want an easy explaination of language-server and haskell-language-server in simple words. If you can also explain it layman&#x27;s term, it would be very helpful, hopefully. I appreciate your help.

                    <span>Taking a shower is a fucking scam. Eating food during the day is a psyop. Brushing your teeth is propaganda. Having sex is complete garbage from the condom industry. Playing games or sports is trash. Having a kid is made up. &quot;Taking a nap&quot; lol what the fuck. Cleaning your house is woke poisoned. Why are you forced to hear a bird in the morning. Having friends is just some shit created by the ad agencies. Feeling happy/sad/afraid/mad/etc. is fake rubbish. Talking to someone is r-slurred

                    <span>I&#x27;ve my Cardano on Yoroi, and recently I got a Ledger Nano X and I would like to move my Cardano there. 
 The thing is I have my Cardano delegated to a stake pool, and I would like to know if it&#x27;s possible to move my Cardano to Ledger, connect my Ledger to Yoroi and keep my Cardano delegated without actually leaving the stake pool? 
 I know I can leave the stake pool and then delegate my Cardano again, but if I do that I will have to wait 2 weeks (I think) again before I continue receiving the rewards.

                    <span>Just to qualify myself, my biggest investment is in ADA. I hold a substantial amount and I would like nothing more than to see everything succeed that is tied to it. But the sundae testnet so far has been very discouraging. I first jumped in on Monday, Dec 6 when it was launched. Nothing worked for me. And there were many UI bugs that should have been fixed prior to a network scalability test (which is what I assume is the main reason to test on public testnet). Today, four days later, I came back to take another shot. Some things have been improved but still seeing many errors and have not seen a successful swap occur. The swap delay is concerning as that enforces the narrative on Cardano not able to handle concurrency. So I asked myself, would I swap or add liquidity on sundae if it was in mainnet today or next week. No. Really looking forward to Hydra, P2P networking and anything else that can improve scalability 
 Would you trade on sundae today or next week? What is your experience? Lets be completely honest

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 I would like to know if anyone has any good experience with ADA games and i don&#x27;t mean only from a profit perspective but also from a fun perspective?
 From my initial search it seems there are already some on the ecosystem, but i was looking for feedback that would help me not having to try them all.
 Thank you.

                    <span>I bought a ledger lately, but failed to sync it with my existing wallet. 
 I know I could make a new wallet but it mean paying the staking fee once again &amp; waiting for 3 epochs... No big deal but if there is a way to avoid that, I would be glad to use it :)

                    <span>I had the privilege of interviewing Ken Olling from MELD, Derrick Emsley and Stephen Emsley from veritree and Jeremy Firster from the Cardano Foundation about the Cardano Global Impact Challenge and how Meld&#x27;s extra epoch of staked rewards will be donated to Veritree and the Cardano Forest.
 It&#x27;s an amazing initiative, and I&#x27;m happy to see the extra rewards donated to help with climate change.
 ​
 Derrick talks about how much reforestation can impact global climate change and how their approach helps the environment and local social development.
 ​
 Stephen describes what the Veritree Token is and what the redeemable NFT might look like. They&#x27;re collaborating with other Cardano community members to have these created for their distribution event.
 ​
 Jeremy talks about the Global Challenge, how Cardano is being used to record and track the data, and how other NGOs are looking at the model to create change in the future.

                    <span>I’m very new when it comes to this stuff. Setting up Daedalus and choosing a stake pool was easy enough but how much more technical knowledge do I need to get involved with Sundaeswap?
 I want to do this for the airdropped Sundaeswap tokens and to delve a bit deeper into the Cardano ecosystem. AFAIK I need to download Nami? Then choose from a list of preselected stake pools who qualified for the ISO? Then I could also contribute to certain LP’s for additional airdropped tokens? Is this right? Did I miss the cutoff date? 
 Is there anything I should be aware of that I’m missing? People said to wait for Yoroi to deploy but what is the benefit of this? Sorry if these are very dumb questions. I’m kind of just figuring this out as I go along. Thanks!

                    <span>So, working on a project I noticed that the minimum balance associated to any UTXO is 1 ADA. So when forming a transaction, there MUST be a --tx-out with a minimum of 1ADA returned as change, stopping you from &quot;zero&#x27;ing out&quot; a UTXO.
 Is there a reason for this? I haven&#x27;t tried it, but, theoretically, that means you have (adaRate * (UTXO:walletAddress)) remaining in an address, which would suck because you&#x27;re essentially saying if you process hundreds or even thousands of transactions on an address, there must be 1ADA left for each UTXO?
 Or if I were to try to transfer all the UTXO balances out, (--tx-in all of the UTXOs) as long as one remains with 1ADA that would be sufficient?
 I can write some of this today, it just sucks that you could possibly have hundreds if not thousands of dollars (ada * market rate) tied up in loose UTXOs.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m a dev interested in the potential of building games on Cardano, and I was wondering if anyone has any readings, discussion, or information they&#x27;d be willing to share on the topic. The scope of this question is rather large, and intentionally so!
 Where should one begin if they wanted to build something like CryptoKitties with Cardano?
 Any information or discussion at all is appreciated.

                    <span>So I&#x27;m trying to implement a caesar cypher (see below). I have a function (caesar) that shifts right, e.g. caesar 1 &quot;abc&quot; would result in &quot;bcd&quot;, that works as intended. Now I was thinking to shift that to the left, I&#x27;d just have to adjust the the shift functions a little, but my current implementation doesn&#x27;t work around the edges, e.g. unCaesar 1 &quot;abc&quot; results in &quot;baz&quot; (?!) . I would love an explanation on why the shiftLeft functions behave like they do :)
 import Data.Char caesar :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; String caesar _ [] &#x3D; [] caesar n (x:xs) &#x3D; shiftRight n x : caesar n xs unCaesar :: Int -&gt; String -&gt; String unCaesar _ [] &#x3D; [] unCaesar n (x:xs) &#x3D; shiftLeft n x : unCaesar n xs shiftRight :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftRight a b | isUpper b &#x3D; shiftRightUpper a b | isLower b &#x3D; shiftRightLower a b | otherwise &#x3D; b shiftLeft :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftLeft a b | isUpper b &#x3D; shiftLeftUpper a b | isLower b &#x3D; shiftLeftLower a b | otherwise &#x3D; b shiftRightLower :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftRightLower a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a + (ord b - ord &#x27;a&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;a&#x27; shiftRightUpper :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char shiftRightUpper a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a + (ord b - ord &#x27;A&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;A&#x27; shiftLeftLower :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char -- doesn&#x27;t work yet shiftLeftLower a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a - (ord b - ord &#x27;a&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;a&#x27; shiftLeftUpper :: Int -&gt; Char -&gt; Char -- doesn&#x27;t work either shiftLeftUpper a b &#x3D; chr $ ((a - (ord b - ord &#x27;A&#x27;)) &#x60;mod&#x60; 26) + ord &#x27;A&#x27;

                    <span>I tried to solve Day 9, part one with algebraic graphs, a library I wanted to try out for a long time. I eventually failed, because my approach (build graph -&gt; remove all vertices that have a lower neighbour -&gt; count the value of the remaining vertices) relies on neighbours :: Ord a &#x3D;&gt; a -&gt; Graph a -&gt; Set a, which has an inefficient implementation (folds the whole graph, hence my algorithm is at least quadratic.) It still works for the example input tho! :)
 I would be glad about answer or general feedback about the my solution:
 -- I seem to need some kind of indexing, otherwise there is no way to distinguish vertexes. -- Question 1: Is there a smarter way to do it? -- 1 2 &#x3D;&gt; neighbours (vertex 1) will look for both 1&#x27;s ((0,0), 1) ((0,1), 2) &#x3D;&gt; Works, but ugly -- 3 1 ((1,0), 3) ((1,1), 1) type Cell &#x3D; ((Int, Int), Int) indexLines :: [[(Int, Int)]] -&gt; [Int] -&gt; [[Cell]] indexLines (i : is) (inf : infs) &#x3D; fmap (\(x, v) -&gt; ((inf, x), v)) i : indexLines is infs indexLines [] _ &#x3D; [] -- I construct the input grid as follows: Construct row1 and row2, overlay them, construct row 2 and row 3, overlay the whole thing etc. -- Question 2: Is there a more elegant way to construct a grid? constructGraphFromInput :: [[Cell]] -&gt; ([Cell], Graph Cell) constructGraphFromInput [] &#x3D; error &quot;Should not happen!&quot; constructGraphFromInput (cs : css) &#x3D; foldl (\(cs_last, acc) cs_cur -&gt; (cs_cur, overlay (addLines cs_last cs_cur) acc)) (cs, empty) css where addLines :: [Cell] -&gt; [Cell] -&gt; Graph Cell addLines u l &#x3D; overlays $ path u : path l : zipWith edge u l solve :: String -&gt; IO () solve s &#x3D; do fileInput  lines fileInput let indexedLines &#x3D; indexLines indexedRows [0 ..] let (_, grid) &#x3D; constructGraphFromInput indexedLines let onlyLowestPoints &#x3D; induce (\v -&gt; snd v  vertexList onlyLowestPoints

                    <span>Looking at the following syntax:
 getValues x1 &#x3D; do
 g &lt;- get
 let name &#x3D; &quot;aName&quot;
 return [Map.lookup x1 (myMap g)]
 ​
  
Does &lt;- get set g to the output of the return line? If not, what does g &lt;- get do?
 x1 appears to be the key to a map lookup, and myMap g is the map, but what is the relationship between the g in myMap g and the g in g &lt;- get. Recursive? There is no g as an argument to getValues.

                    <span>Type-checking plugins interface directly with GHC’s constraint solver. This means we need to have
a certain level of familiarity with how GHC generates, manipulates and solves constraints.
In this post, we will attempt to demystify this constraint solving process, as well as review
a few aspects of type-family reduction, to facilitate the development of type-checking plugins.
This post will serve as a reference, when we start writing our own type-checking plugins in Part III.
Don’t worry: you don’t need to know everything before you start writing your own plugins!
It’s only when debugging a type-checking plugin that the rubber hits the road:
a few skills become rather important, such as the ability to understand the different types of constraints,

                    <span>Me and my friends are mining Bitcoin, but we love and hold Cardano almost one year, so now we decided to put our earnings into Cardano and stake it. I dont know if its smart, but time will show us. Such a nice price for entry.

                    <span>As a financial services professional without developer skills I am very excited to see Marlowe get released. I think the utility and use case potential can really open the door on Cardano becoming mainstream in financial services.
 If any of the tech savvy Plutus/Marlowe folks in the community have good insights for a non-coder like me, please let me know.

 Let&#x27;s go...
 Newly covered today:
  
Charles dropped a new AMA! https://youtu.be/Jex6wItSvzE
 In macro news that could affect all of crypto including Cardano, it looks like Evergrande (one of the largest real estate developers in the world) has finally formally defaulted on its debt obligations. While Evergrand has been stumbling for a long time, this event could mark the beginning of a new phase in global economics. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/china-evergrande-kaisa-property.html https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/evergrande-set-for-restructuring-with-no-word-on-first-formal-default.html

                    <span>Hey there, 
 I need your guys help. A friend of mine, who will get a dad soon, is a fan of cardano. So i&#x27;ve decided to gift him a which wallet, which stakes and can be forgotten for years. 
 My plan was to just sent ADA to the wallet, choose a staking pool through Daedalus or a other wallet, delete the software and gift him the private key. In 10 or 15 years he could use the money for his child. 
 But ive red that staking pools vary on payout ratio, depending on how many people use it. 
 Actually im fine with the APR going up and down a bit. Market should rule that right?
 But is it possible that a staking pool gets taken down? What happens then? Do you have suggestions to make this gift work?
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>With all the optimisation and now Sundae Swap stress testing the test net. Prior to the release of Hydra what kind of TPS can we expect? Granted testnet and main net are different, so shall I rephrase the question: now that some optimisation has been done on the main net what TPS should we expect?

                    <span>This has probably been thought of before, and there may already devs working on something like this, could you use NFTs for event tickets and build in an anti scalping system into a smart contract. For example, the mint price being the price of the ticket, if the ticket is resold, any amount over the mint price goes to the artist/venue. Or could the smart contract limit the resale price to the mint price. This would essentially make scalping pointless.

                    <span>This is late, but I took a closer listen to Charles Hoskinson&#x27;s video On DApps. It was released December 2nd, 2021. So it happened before the Sundae Swap testnet. It really would have been nice to get Charles thoughts on the testnet, but I suspect he&#x27;s thinking so long-term, he&#x27;s not that concerned about anyone particular DApp. 
 Key points:
  
dApp certification is under development, targeting 2022 release. Idea is to have 4 levels of certification for apps on the dApps store in a light wallet: [Uncertified, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3]. Apps in the dApp store will have their certification level as meta-data that the end-user can view.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve never used a Dex and am relatively new to Defi, but as I lean more about how these Dexs work they don&#x27;t seem to be decentralized at all. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but it seems you need to use a centralized Web interface, controlled entirely by the team that produced it. They do the swaps off-chain (e.g. using a &quot;scooper&quot; on SundaeSwap), and then the final transactions are batched and recorded on the blockchain. So, it seems Cardano is only involved in the settlement process, not in the swap process.
 I envisioned a swap smart contract that accepted buy- and sell-order transactions, matched them up, and did the swap and settlement all autonomously. Users could submit these transactions using their wallet or the Cardano CLI. After the smart contract was published, the team that developed it could dissolve and the smart contract would remain and run indefinitely.
 Is the current centralization and dependency on a 3rd party team like SundaeSwap Labs just temporary while we wait for Hydra or other technologies on the Cardano network to be developed, or am I expecting too much?

                    <span>I&#x27;m looking through the blockfrost api and the googles and am not finding what I’m looking for. I was hoping to be able to pass in &#x60;walletAddress&#x60; and &#x60;policyId&#x60; and have it return assets from that policy that are owned by that wallet. 
 Here&#x27;s an example of someone else doing it for Hosky: https://rudigus.github.io/hority/?wallet&#x3D;addr1v86kueglt6y5au9nvpa85ytu8qfjqldjh4gptvfu4qnacrsqsfy2w 
 By the way, I&#x27;m going to use &#x60;blockfrost-js&#x60; for this. 
 Thanks!

 💡AVOUM is a technology that enables contracts to be written and used as per the account model made famous by Ethereum, on top of a blockchain built on the UTXO model like Cardano. 
 🗓️ Tomorrow (December 9th) at 4pm UTC, François-René will share insight into AVOUM and the technicalities of the project on our Discord Stage.

                    <span>I am trying to write an IO action that bugs the user to enter a number within a certain range.
 Since the user is entering the number from the keyboard, I have to allow the possibility that
 the user types in something that cannot be converted into an Int value.
 ​
 This is what I have so far
 ​
 action2 :: Int -&gt; IO Int
 action2 n &#x3D; do
 putStrLn &quot;\nEnter action2 ...&quot;
 ​
 let m &#x3D; 2 * n 
 ​
 putStrLn $ &quot;n &#x3D; &quot; ++ (show n)
 putStrLn &quot;... leave action2\n&quot;

                    <span>If I were a teacher of high-schoolers wanting to connect some underlying theory to Haskell, could I explain Haskell list comprehensions as basically just a Cartesian/cross product machine? Would this be accurate? And then the combinatorics product rule also seems at play here. I would appreciate any theoretical explanation of what a list comprehension is about.
 Edit: Looking at the Report I can see and understand the details, but somehow that list of facts in the &quot;Translations&quot; box implies, results in the Cartesian product. I&#x27;d like to know how and why.
 Edit 2.0: I guess I&#x27;m just trying to fathom what exactly a list comprehension is. The obvious answer is it&#x27;s supposed to be some sort of set comprehension. But if a standard use of it is like this
 [(x,y) | x&lt;-xs, y&lt;-ys] 
 producing the Cartesian product, then it&#x27;s obvious the Cartesian product is built into this thing, i.e., that Haskell Report description is creating a Cartesian product machine with the ability to ad lib seeming non-binary relation Cartesian things when we want. So even if I do this
 [x+x | x&lt;-[2]] [4] 
 I&#x27;m still using (or bypassing most of) that same inherent Cartesian product mechanism. This gets silly
 [x+y | x&lt;-[1..10], y&lt;-[1..10], x &#x3D;&#x3D; y, x &#x3D;&#x3D; 2] [4] 
 but yes, this is a Cartesian &quot;all possible combinations&quot; product, which is then filtered. If I&#x27;m right, this is marvelous, i.e., a &quot;generalized&quot; Cartesian product algorithm-thingy.

                    <span>SundaeSwap DEX runs on Cardano test-net. We bring you a tutorial on how to try out the token swap. We&#x27;ll show you how to prepare a Nami wallet (without HW wallet support), connect it to the SundaeSwap test-net and do a simple swap of tokens.

                    <span>There&#x27;s a lot of Dexes besides SundaeSwap that did their own testnet way back and barely talked about in this subreddit. Even though it wasn&#x27;t the testnet phase, I haven&#x27;t seen any post talking about any other Dexes that might go live first than SundaeSwap or any other topic regarding any of them. Is it because SundaeSwap&#x27;s marketing team is good or is it just because Charles supports this project?
 Edit: I saw people asking what are the other dexes. Besides SundaeSwap, there&#x27;s Minswap, Maladex, Cardax, Ardana, Ergodex (but I&#x27;ve seen a few post regariding this dex in the past), Matrixswap, and Mirquir. I dunno If I missed one. All I know is Minswap is already done with their testnet but not sure about the other dexes.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying understand the rationale, I thought this community is one of the most mature one out there but it got me thinking as to why everyone&#x27;s been saying SundaeSwap was the first? Even on other social medias SundaeSwap is hailed as &quot;first&quot; and only few people are commenting that MuesliSwap was actually first
 Can someone explain me why SundaeSwap is first when it&#x27;s in testnet and MuesliSwap was on the mainnet? Forgive my ignorance

                    <span>Hey Everyone!
 Let&#x27;s go...
 Newly covered today:
  
SundaeSwap went live on testnet with a faucet for free testnet ADA and various ice cream flavored free testnet tokens. All compatible with Nami. https://twitter.com/SundaeSwap/status/1467795614633185280
 ADA Handles were a surprise integration into the SundaeSwap Testnet! https://twitter.com/adahandle/status/1467907015972323328
 The testnet proved valuable quickly as some improvements were identified with the scooper and they were taken offline to make those changes. https://twitter.com/SundaeSwap/status/1467897465768665090
 Here is a beautiful illustration of massive concurrency in action on Cardano’s testnet! https://twitter.com/ProfSmith9000/status/1467978254912946184/photo/1

 Starting at 22:30
 The one thing I want for Christmas is for everyone to start getting along in our industry. It&#x27;s extraordinary to me that when people are so close in philosophy and viewpoint, and in some cases technology, they can be so far apart as people. It&#x27;s extraordinary.
 You don&#x27;t see this in other industries. You don&#x27;t see in physics or biology, or cellphone manufacturing, or whatever, pick an industry, the amount of tribalism, hate, and vitriol that our industry has for each other. And as long as we&#x27;re doing that to each other, there&#x27;s no reality where we&#x27;re ever going to be able to overcome the real enemy, which is the legacy systems that hold three billion people and the human race down, destroy our environment, and divide us in ways that make us hate people we&#x27;ve never met and should never have grievances against.
 That has to stop. And the only way it&#x27;s going to stop is if we get better systems that are more fair. And the only way we do that, is we have to work together. So, we&#x27;ll see, 2022 whether that&#x27;s accomplished. People will still try to divide us. Books will be published. Podcasters will say things. Reddit and Twitter will continue to pour rivers of verbal diarrhea. But it&#x27;s up to each and every one of us to transcend that, step above it, and realize that we have a finite window.

                    <span>Someone asked about IELE during the AMA and Charles said he thinks we&#x27;ll have an end of year update on IELE from Runtime Verification (RV) so he didn&#x27;t want to front run that but that RV has made an enormous amount of progress this year. He said Cardano is bringing the IELE testnet with Mamba and there will be an IELE sidechain with Mamba coming to Cardano in 2022. They are targeting C and C++.

                    <span>I am a Blockchain Master student (not a Dev though) who went through an incubation program for my DApp idea that is to tackle the poor postal infrastructure in the Global South, particularly Africa. I also got a fast grant of 30k from NEAR Protocol pitching them my idea. My plan now is to get a team together and start building on several BCs among them Cardano as its vision with respect to Africa is highly complementary. Also, the Catalyst program for initial funding could be the next step. At the end out of this DApp idea a DAO shall be established over time. Feel free to reach out if you want to build a DApp with a real world use case.

                    <span>Cardano DID method
 Preamble
 This post is regarding a draft Decentralised ID (DID) method for the Cardano Blockchain. I would love to hear people&#x27;s feedback on how it can be improved!
 You can also check out the github for the idea and propose changes directly and keep up to date with alterations.
 Introduction
 Cardano is a public blockchain platform. It is open-source and decentralized, with consensus achieved using proof of stake. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its internal cryptocurrency, Ada. Cardano DID method is a proposed implementation of Decentralised ID (DID) for the Cardano Blockchain and provides a concrete specification for Cardano-specific DID. This method is valid for both the Cardano mainnet and testnet.

                    <span>I&#x27;m new to learning about Cardano. I&#x27;ve got a question about the interaction between native tokens and smart contracts - how can conditions be imposed on the transfer of tokens on Cardano?
 On Ethereum for example we know any token that isn&#x27;t ether is a second class citizen and requires interaction with a smart contract to do anything. We know this has all sorts of disadvantages and introduces an overhead in terms of computation required on the EVM.
 But one advantage is that whilst settlement itself is computationally more intensive than needed, it would be very natural to impose conditions on the terms of settlement since that just requires augmenting the smart contract that already necessarily exists.
 How can conditions be imposed on Cardano when tokens are native citizens? Is there an elegant way to force the owner of a token to interact with a smart contract (and the computation layer) before settlement? 
 Conceptually speaking, I would imagine the way to do this is to impose datums on every UTXO, then having that self-propagate onto the next UTXO when the transaction is built. But can this be codified at the time of minting? Because my understanding of the resources I&#x27;ve read so far only mentions minting policy, which seems to only concern things like minting and burning.
 Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m issuing tokens that contain the hashes for something that should be non-transferrable - a university degree, or some form of identification. On Ethereum I could simply write into the smart contract conditions to prevent me from sending the ERC-721 token out of my account. How can this be done on Cardano, and when and where would I need to enumerate these conditions?

                    <span>Again, following through the tutorial found at 
 https://developers.cardano.org/docs/integrate-cardano/listening-for-payments-cli
 I realized that this is a simple example (but of course it is), for listening for a single payment. But what in the instance of multiple payments for the same product?
 For example: If you have a product that you want to sell, say for 1 ADA (1,000,000 Lovelace), once you receive that, your rawUTXOTable (in this example) would always be positive...meaning if anyone else came along and bought that same product, listening for it would always say the purchase has been made.
 Now, I get it. A more complicated transaction would need to happen with metadata...but seems short sighted to not build the tutorial for this portion?
 ...I mean theoretically you could always add the UTXO you received initially to a list to avoid, but that only restricts you in one manner...*meh*

 import Numeric.Natural 
 myNat &#x3D; -1 :: Natural
 then I try this and get
 myNat 
 Exception: arithmetic underflow
 no different from just
 -1 :: Natural 
 Exception: arithmetic underflow
 With the first equating Haskell seems to wait until I call myNat to say something, and then it gives what seems a cryptic error message. What&#x27;s going on under the hood here?

                    <span>I know it&#x27;s likely a silly sentiment, however, today marks my first ever passive reward for staking with Cardano, and I&#x27;m over the moon! 
 I&#x27;ve already invested around 4 times more than my initial staking, and I don&#x27;t plan to stop anytime soon.
 It seems like a picked a crazy time to join the community, but since joining I&#x27;ve already learned a lot, and I cannot wait to see where this journey takes me!
 Here&#x27;s to all those investing in themselves and the future!

                    <span>I didn&#x27;t see this question asked here so would like to know.
 I am not an expert on SundaeSwap. This is what I got from the SundawSwap post on here.

                    <span>Hello all, I just wanted to introduce myself to the community. I am new to Cardano, not to crypto. I used this current dip to buy in and though its not what most would say a lot. It is what I wanted to put in at this moment. I do will be creeping around on here to learn more about the project and to keep updated. 
 ​
 I thank all in advance for any welcomes. If they are F@ck off replies then FU2. hahaha. I hope all have a great day!

                    <span>There is a fun &quot;game&quot; emerging on the Cardano blockchain, which will soon be played by matchmakers on MuesliSwap and by Scoopers on SundaySwap etc. Here is a simplified version of the game, useful for thinking about optimal strategies:
 The game: 
 Imagine there are 10 prices: $1, $2, $3, ..., $10. There are also 100 players. The game is simple: each player writes down which prize they want, without looking at other people&#x27;s entry. Then, the players simply receive the price they wrote down! However, if multiple people write down the same prize, the price is given randomly to one of the people who wanted it. Which prize would you choose? You might instantly want to pick $10, but if many people think like that, the chances of getting this prize is low, leading to a low expected (or average) …</span>

                    <span>Before attempting to try the testnet please add Collateral on your NAMI Wallet and make sure it’s on Testnet and not Mainnet! This will allow your wallet to actually interact with the DEX test, otherwise you’ll be stuck with pending transactions forever. 
 Good luck!

                    <span>I thought I would update everyone not sitting in Discord on the Developer&#x27;s feedback. Overall, they see it as a success so far. There are issues with the scoopers which is causing a transaction backlog. That seems to be the big issue. They&#x27;ve had to bring them down while the work out the bugs (so the backlog will continue). But no issues with the Cardano network/protocol! Only with the scoopers and UI:

                    <span>I know that Muesliswap is not very well-liked by a big part of the community because they have no audits and anon team. However I just swapped some tokens (WMT-ADA) on Muesliswap and I have to say that it works smoothly and it feels really cool to do some actual DeFi on Cardano! I would say that even if you&#x27;re skeptical about the project, it is fun to try it with a small amount of tokens!

                    <span>SundaeSwap Flavours
 First of all - sry for my bad englisch and my semi good understanding of od DEX and sundaeswap in special. Im really into Ada and try to participate in new projects like sundaeswap and right now im on the Testnet to get familiar wirh the upcoming mainnet… i have a small understanding what a dex is and what liquiditiy pools are for - but what i don’t understand is, why are there different types sundaeswap tokens? like choc, mint, sberry, rberry? what is the different between them and what is the difference in their value? if i pair choc and ada to a pool - why could this be better or worse compared to ada - rberry?
 hope you guys can help me out - i really dont get this 😬 Thx

                    <span>Keen to hear members’ thoughts on the Cardano Foundation. 
 It often feels like IOG does the lion’s share of heavy lifting when it comes to active communication and promotion of Cardano’s capability and strengths. I had renewed hopes for the system’s adoption strategy and marketing following the overhaul of the Foundation in late 2020. 
 Maybe I’m missing something or not looking in the right places? 
 Keen to hear the Foundation’s views also.
 Thanks all, be well.

                    <span>Just a few brief comments, some of our engineers worked with the sundae team to help optimize some of their scripts. We&#x27;ve been trying to extend this help to many DEXes and applications in the ecosystem.
 It&#x27;s very important to understand that developing on Cardano is a new experience for the vast majority of the community and it will require some time for projects to fully understand, become productive, and deliver their DApps. The point of testnets are to provide early adopters and software developers a chance to iron out many issues that could impact quality, security, or user experience. Thus, by defintion, issues are expected, bugs should be encountered, and delays will happen. It&#x27;s part of the process and I&#x27;m sure tbe team is hard at work chipping away at these things.

Cardano has reached one million wallets staked. https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1467351929047044096
 Cardano still remains secure. Meanwhile a gigantic bug in Solana that could have been exploited for six months was reported. https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/126318/solana-library-bug-could-have-seen-attackers-stealing-27-million-an-hour

                    <span>could use some guidance. If I want to buy ADA on coinbase, Is it unsafe to keep it on coinbase? Do I have to have a separate wallet? This would be my first crypto investment and although I did read some of the DD here… i feel like it got MORE confusing. Can I treat coinbase like any other brokerage and just keep my coins there?

                    <span>First of all, set your Nami wallet to testnet.

 ​
 Second, set your colateral otherwise you won&#x27;t be able to do anything

 ​
 This thing will ask your password, default colateral is 5 tAda.
 ​
 Enter in the faucet and ask some tAda
 https://testnets.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/tools/faucet/
 If you want some of mine test net tokens I created a project in nft maker pro testnet so you just need to send tAda to these address in the exact amounts
 CheffTestnet 17 tAda &#x3D; 1,000,000
 addr_test1vqj0fj4rzhzasnngadrktn0ulsr9v2qdnmdscy67mstucms0m82kp
 HoskyTestnet 6,5 tAda &#x3D; 1,000,000
 addr_test1vzkmexszjlp7l9lvx0vpderuq2244dfshvncaxfarcu9mccca6fsv
 That&#x27;s it, you receive your tokens and you can add liquidity and do swaps!

                    <span>👋 Hey guys, so I&#x27;m fairly new to the whole Cardano developer ecosystem. I am currently learning solidity and its in and outs. I have recently began reading on the workings of cardano, its academic background and foundation and believe it has potential to be a great blockchain if not the best if more developers hop on board.
 So as a result I&#x27;m interested in learning how to develop cardano dapps, I know that Haskell is a non conditional prerequisite that one must learn to enter this space. What I would like to know is how much Lambda Calculus is truly need for me to know in order to create full functioning quality Dapps with Haskel. I will admit im not the strongest in math but I am capable of learning lambda if need be, I just need to know if it&#x27;s something I MUST know in order to be a functional cardano dev.
 ​
 thanks in advance for any responses.

 Or is there is a savings in sending bulk transactions like this?

                    <span>data Letters &#x3D; A | B | C deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded, Enum, Show) instance (Eq a, Ord a, Bounded a, Enum a) &#x3D;&gt; Enum [a] where succ &#x3D; reverse . succ&#x27; . reverse where succ&#x27; :: [a] -&gt; [a] succ&#x27; (x:xs) | x  Buildable a where build :: a -&gt; a -&gt; [a] build start end &#x3D; reverse $ build&#x27; start end [] where build&#x27; :: a -&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] build&#x27; x y l | x &gt;&#x3D; (minBound :: a) &amp;&amp; x &#x3D; (minBound :: a) &amp;&amp; x &lt;&#x3D; y &amp;&amp; x &#x3D;&#x3D; (maxBound :: a) &#x3D; l++[x] | otherwise &#x3D; l instance Buildable Letters 
 I have defined succ so that it can be applied to all permutation of [Letters] with a ordered sequence like this:
 succ [A,A,A] &#x3D; [A,A,B] succ [A,A,B] &#x3D; [A,A,C] succ [A,A,C] &#x3D; [A,B,A] ... succ [C,C,B] &#x3D; [C,C,C] -- succ [C,C,C] is not defined 
 build in Buildable is given the start and end value, it builds a ordered list of every element in the set including start and end:
 build A B &#x3D; [A,B] build B C &#x3D; [B,C] build A C &#x3D; [A,B,C] 
 ​
 How do I apply Buildable on [Letters] such that I can call build like this:
 build [A] [B] &#x3D; [[A],[B]] build [A,A] [B,B] &#x3D; [[A,A],[A,B],[B,A],[B,B]] build [A,A,A] [A,A,C] &#x3D; [[A,A,A],[A,A,B],[A,A,C]] build [B,B,C] [B,C,C] &#x3D; [[B,B,C],[B,C,A],[B,C,B],[B,C,C]] 
 It seems like I have to define what maxBound and minBound is for [Letters] if I do instance Buildable [a]. How do I do that?

                    <span>I want to get back into Haskell. I used it a lot a few years ago. I just installed haskell-platform on Ubuntu which seems to be the recommended download.
 Should I be using stack to make Haskell projects? stack wasn&#x27;t included in the haskell-platform download so is there a different workflow I should be using? I have some projects on github that I made with stack.
 Any help or other new advice would be nice
 ​
 Edit: Thaqnks for the installation advice, is there anything else new in Haskell worth knowing about?

                    <span>Although the feature is still marked as experimental, the release of Nix 2.4 marks the entry of content-addressed derivations in a released Nix version.
This is something to celebrate, but also an occasion to look back and see what this addition means, implementation wise.
This new feature required indeed some deep changes both in the high-level algorithm describing the build loop (and also as a consequence in its low-level details) as well as in the “plumbing” code around it.
Note: Because it touches the implementation, this post will be more technical than the others, and will also assume that you’re somewhat familiar with what content-addressed derivations means, and how it works. If you haven’t done it already, I invite you to read the previous blog articles on the topic (1, 2 and 3), …</span>

where we shared our varied Haskell setups with each other, and learned some
nice tricks and tips for every-day life.
The idea was raised of sharing these findings via the blog, so without further
ado, let’s explore the varieties of the Tweag Haskelling experience by
covering a few of our personal setups!

                    <span>During my internship at Tweag, I worked on creating a
safe interface for the sparkle library under the excellent mentorship of Facundo
Domínguez. sparkle is a Haskell library that provides bindings for
Apache Spark using inline-java’s Java interop capabilities.
As such, this new safe interface accomplishes the same
thing that inline-java’s safe interface does; it helps to ensure safe
management of Java references at compile-time using linear types.
As discussed in this earlier post,
we need to be careful to free Java references provided by inline-java when they’re done
being used, and we also shouldn’t use them after they’ve been freed. Since sparkle
manipulates references to Java objects defined in the Spark Java library, any potential users
must take care to safely manage references when…</span>
