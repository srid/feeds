                    <span>I&#x27;m really loving how the roadmap for 2022 Cardano is coming together. It&#x27;s a living ecosystem, growing, refining, adapting, and becoming stronger. The technology is unbelievable and we have so many great innovations coming to meet the hundreds of projects building on Cardano

                    <span>Is anyone creating some version of HEX on Cardano? We need this! Or at least we should have it. Obviously not with the huge amount to the founder, but something more fair, and with a website where people can see a graph of penalties paid. I really like the pumpamentals. People buy and stake to prevent dilution, and people who don&#x27;t stake are diluted, which means that stakers will have a larger percentage wise amount of tokens. And if people unstake too early, then stakers win even more, because of the penalties paid for unstaking too early. Also very limited supply, so the price can skyrocket, which will give an incentive to unstake early(to sell the token), which means more penalties paid and more for stakers. What&#x27;s not to like?
 Please someone make this. It is way better than stupid meme tokens, and I guess kinda easy to make compared to other projects. :-)

 How can I get my coins back? I have the transaction data in my history.

 Thinking of getting in on the ADALend private sale (it&#x27;s still on). What are your thoughts on it?
 Also, would be great if you could share your DYOR conclusions if you can, as I start doing mine.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Maybe you also missed this Summit news video: Bitrue exchange announced that ADA is becoming on of their base pairs. 
 And they will list Cardano DApps coins. 
 Does anyone has an account at Bitrue and can verify that ADA is now a base pair on their exchange ? 
 Not sure if it has something to do with that ADA acts as a stablecoin the last weeks. But a base pair coin has to be very stable . 
 Here the video https://youtu.be/NBLkaV7jH50 I just stumbled on .

                    <span>Is there any published data showing area were most of the ADA transactions are created? I would like to know if having nodes in those location (lower latency) help your stakepool? 
 Example, To me it does not make sense to have 2 relay nodes in same city. Seems better to spread them out..
 Any other thoughts?
 Thanks

                    <span>It&#x27;s my understanding that the max saturation limit for a stake pool is 64M.
 Does this mean when the pool we&#x27;re staking our ADA with reaches 64M, we need to manually find a new pool? Thanks!

                    <span>I’m not sure if this is possible and I suspect that this is a no, but is there anyway to link my app to my Trezor hardware wallet overview.
 Ideally I’d like to keep an eye on the amount and that which is being staked through through the APP.
 Fully aware I won’t be able to actually change or remove anything which connecting the Trezor to the laptop and moving it manually, however being able to see thing will always be nice.
 Anyone reading this thinking - I’m gonna pm the noob for their keys or tell him they need to be transferred somewhere else, please jog on. It’ll just be another account on the block and report list. 
 I’m not sure if I’m being really stupid but I can’t see an easy way to do this. Thanks in advance for your help 👌🏼

                    <span>Hello,
 I am looking to partner with someone to help build a DAO on Cardano. This person would be in charge of the technical side of the project. This project is ambitious, and I know this is a large task on any developer who answers this call. 
 The idea is rather simple. Users stake their Cardano within our DAO. In return, users earn our token. The DAO will keep the Cardano staking rewards. Then, users can use our token to vote on which non-profits / charities the DAO will donate the staking rewards to.
 A little bit about me, I have experience as a software project manager, and I have been involved in crypto for several years. 
 Thank you to anyone who shows interest in joining me on this venture. I welcome any feedback or questions about the project in the comments section.
 Regards,
 ExcelsiorDAO

                    <span>So I want to learn how to mint native tokens on Cardano, specifically NFTs so I can start working on some ideas I have for NFT projects. I followed a guide to install a node on a VM (Ubuntu) and everything went fine until I let my laptop synch with the blockchain and while it was synching windows decided to make a random update and now I have some issues running it again. I have lost motivation about running it on my laptop, which maybe wasn&#x27;t the ideal choice because of the limited 8 GB ram it has. 
 Anyway I have a good PC with better specs but I have windows, can somebody give me some direction on a way to install and run a Cardano node and cli on Windows or is it just not a good option? I have Daedalus installed and that is a node from what I have read so can it save me time from installing a node or even synching with the blockchain? Sorry for the noob questions I&#x27;m still learning about this and remember all of this is just because I want to play around with minting my own nft&#x27;s.

                    <span>Hello Cardano developers,
 Some of you, including me, may feel that Haskell is very different from imperative programming languages. As a Python developer who got into Haskell because of Cardano, when learning this language, I could still see that Haskell, despite being very different, shares quite a lot similarities with Python. 
 As a practice and a form of learning reinforcement, I created a project, py2hs, to document how some frequently used programming patterns (e.g. functor, applicative) are implemented in Python and Haskell respectively. If you are a Python developer who just started learning Haskell, hope you can find this material helpful in some way.
 In terms of future development, I will keep improving existing contents and adding more examples as time allowed. Also, any contributions from the community is more than welcome. Hope we can together make it a better learning material and help more Cardano developers!
 Jerry

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m having a terrible time with haskell. I&#x27;m taking a class in college, office hours are offered but only when I&#x27;m working and i can&#x27;t make it in for help during them. I&#x27;m looking for someone available in the evenings 7 or later EST. The first topic I&#x27;m looking for guidance in would be parsing. 
 Thanks

 currently I&#x27;m trying to learn Haskell but I am a person that depends heavily on exercises or practicing
 their newly acquired knowledge. I&#x27;m following learn you a Haskell and Real world Haskell but
 I&#x27;d like to get more experience and knowledge by doing exercises..
 Could someone point me in the right direction and to some exercises or old homeworks?
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Data.Vector.Unboxed essentially gives a Structure of Arrays representation - Vector (a,b) can be stored as (Vector a, Vector b). 
 This has some minor issues - deriving doesn&#x27;t really work, writing the typeclass by hand is really annoying, GHC cannot optimize away dead reads if you only use one field - but overall it&#x27;s a reasonably nice and composable abstraction.
 I&#x27;m currently playing with some code which accepts messages and must store them efficiently before they get batch-executed. To make this extensible I&#x27;d like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.
 But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn&#x27;t matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.
 This lead me to a number of questions:
  
Is there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?
 Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational
 Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -&gt; Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values
 Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like
  
 
type ExtractPII &#x3D; { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; 
 If people have ideas to any of these points I&#x27;d really like to hear about them!

                    <span>Hello, I am working on two functions that filter values from a list of Cupcake type objects, and I am getting a &quot;Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive&quot; error when running them, which causes any example I try on them to give me *** Exception: Assessed3.hs:(25,1)-(31,67): Non-exhaustive patterns in function priceRange.
 I really don&#x27;t see anything wrong:
 priceRange :: Price -&gt; Price -&gt; [Cupcake] -&gt; [Cupcake]
 priceRange minprice maxprice [] &#x3D; []
 priceRange minprice maxprice [CC p i] &#x3D; [CC p i | pricelower minprice p, pricelower p maxprice]
 where
 pricelower :: Price -&gt; Price -&gt; Bool
 pricelower (P x) (P y) 
 | x&lt;&#x3D;y &#x3D; True
 | otherwise &#x3D; False
 Assessed3.hs:25:1: warning: [-Wincomplete-patterns]
 Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive
 In an equation for ‘priceRange’:
 Patterns not matched:
 (P _) (P _) ((CC (P _) []):_:_)
 (P _) (P _) ((CC (P _) (_:_)):_:_)
 |
 25 | priceRange minprice maxprice [] &#x3D; [] 
 For this it says I didn&#x27;t match the two cases in which the list inside is empty or non empty but I really don&#x27;t see how that will give me an error.

 I saw this: https://stackoverflow.com/q/14397128/9481613

 By far the worst tho are people who assume that anyone who hates rich people is just jealous of them.
 Anyway, billionaires aren’t human and their heads belong on spikes. I sincerely hope we break out the guillotine for them in my lifetime.
 Kill the rich. They aren’t human and they don’t deserve our kindness or sympathy.

                    <span>Haskell’s laziness gives us
great
benefits,
but comes with costs.
One of the most visible cost of laziness is hard to predict memory behavior, and so we
have, and need, tools to profile and measure the heap of our Haskell programs.
Most of the time, we live in a high-level world of type classes, monoids, and
isomorphisms. But at the end of the day our code needs to run on actual
machines, and when our code is run it needs to be performant. Typically, “be
performant”, means “have reasonable computational complexity” and so we usually
focus on good asymptotic behavior instead of constant costs. But when our
programs meet our CPUs, constant costs are important, and thus having low level
tools is helpful for low level optimizations, i.e., when you want to squeeze
that last 10% out of your prog…</span>

                    <span>After being convinced of the usefulness of code formatters by the excellent scalafmt, which is very widely used in the Scala ecosystem, I was on the lookout for a similar tool for Haskell. In 2018, most options did not completely cut it for me, due to e.g. only formatting certain parts of the source file or having many unfortunate bugs. Upon discovering Ormolu in 2019, I was first appalled by its style, but this reaction was only short-lived, as I found these stylistic preferences to be easily malleable via familiarisation.
I started using Ormolu for all personal projects, and submitted bug reports and minor pull requests. Therefore, an internship to work on Ormolu full-time came like a call!

II: GHC’s constraint solver
III: Writing a type-checking plugin
In this first blog post of the series, I’ll be outlining a few
examples that showcase some limitations in GHC’s instance resolution
and type family reduction mechanisms. With a type-checker plugin, we
are no longer restricted by these limitations, and can decide ourselves
how to solve constraints and reduce type families.
