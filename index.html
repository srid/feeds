                    <span>Greetings! I am not really sure where to start with this. but essentially me and a group of friends have purchased a theatre and most of the surrounding buildings in a town on the west coast USA. I can&#x27;t really give away the whole plan yet, but we have pretty big things in the works to create a very large music/culture/event venue. We want to be one of the first venues to be built on the cardano blockchain, and I figured it couldnt hurt to reach out to the community! We are looking for ideas to incorporate cardano into our project, as well as possibly help with the publicity that we hope to capitalize on by using cryptocurrency in the new digital age! 
 Thank you, cheers!

                    <span>As an early adopter in Cardano, I was blessed to have decent bags as dapps get ready to launch. I&#x27;m no whale, more like jellyfish, but I still feel blessed.
 So this Christmas in recognition of dapps launching next year, I&#x27;ve decided to send all my personal friends who don&#x27;t own Cardano or Crypto a ledger nano and 50 free ADA. Not promising them some get rich scheme, but giving free access to play and learn in the easiest project for introduction to the space.
 This is something I considered before, but it was always too complicated. Trying to explain to someone who doesn&#x27;t feel they have the time what are gas fee&#x27;s, polygon vs Ethereum networks, why so many different wallets, etc, etc was wayyy too complicated. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, in true ape fashion, I jumped in and blew money playing around and made some gains in areas too. However, I could not expect that from friends or family. Cardano&#x27;s native asset management through a single wallet address, security of the hard fork combinator with upgrades, and the coming dapp wave has finally pushed me to do this on a project in the blockchain space. Having them imagine that instead of a jpeg of nothingness, imagine that&#x27;s just one of many health records or property housing deeds, credit worthiness or any other data we currently give to tens to hundreds of companies to store and expose to hacks.
 Anyways, thought it was a good idea for adoption, and wanted to share in case any other fortunate community members wanted to share their ideas and help push adoption through free, understandable introductions.
 Have a wonderful holiday season community, here&#x27;s to 2022 🍻🍻🥂

                    <span>Just stumbled upon this article and I thought I&#x27;d give you a quick overview of why I&#x27;m really pumped for what&#x27;s arriving next month.
 ​
 DeFi Ecosystem on Cardano
 DeFi requires you to have --&gt; A web wallet (NAMI, YOROI, etc) which will let you:
  
Make swaps / Provide liquidity on DEXes (SundaeSwap)
 Use leveraged instruments and synthetic assets (Indigoprotocol)
 Optimize your yield farming (Geniusyield)
 Trade NFTs (Cnft)
  
Turns out we have all that... It&#x27;s all ready to be unleashed, once the PAB is released by Jan 2022.
 I personally made good ROI during the DeFi season in 2020 by aping in DEXes. Seems to have a very good R / R overall. I&#x27;m targetting SundaeSwap + Cardashift incubated DEX. NFA
 The days of Cardano being poked for having little to show for, is now undeniably coming to an end. I know where my money will be next year anon. Do you ?

                    <span>In one of his videos on his YouTube channel, Charles Hoskinson once talked about a conversation he had with one of the creators of the internet. CH was basically reflecting upon the regrets the man expressed over designed decisions that had been made that were horrible and that have led to creating an internet with many vulnerabilities... and how he wanted things to be different for Cardano. 
 CH then reiterated his commitment to ensuring that Cardano become a massive financial system that had to be built rightly from the start, so that when it is all said and done, he would feel differently about Cardano than what that man did about the internet. (The internet is to big now to make major changes to some of the past design decisions). CH doesn’t approve of the “move fast, break things” culture of the software culture. Ethereum, for example, is still figuring out how to deal with some of their past poor design decisions, just like that internet founder.
 Which brings me to this interview I’ve been watching where the Charli3 team through their communication with IOHK had their code audited by a very reputable company. This allowed Charli3 to find issues early in their codebase. And even though none of the issues were devastating, they were important enough to merit revisions. CH is also intent on the creation of certification programs to give Dapps the option to vet their code to ensure a minimum standard of quality and safety. 
 This may seem inconsequential now as Cardano’s ecosystem is still in the early days of its growth, but this is going to bring massive changes to the Dapp ecosystem in crypto in the long-run. And the quality of the Dapps on Cardano at launch will be high and likelihood of security flaws will be reduced significantly. This is going to be a huge game changer for the crypto space, and will be a major selling point for adoption and trust from users and businesses alike.

                    <span>Hi there! I am from India and I want to setup Cardano node in my place. As you might have guessed I am a complete beginner when it comes to technical part of staking/delegation and node setup. Can anybody help me with the setup process and potential hardware/software cost for initial setup of cardano node? Thanks in advance. Cheers!

                    <span>I have a little bit of understanding about the ERC20 Converter... I know it locks up the tokens on Etherium and creates a Cardano equivalent that can be used or traded. But what happens if someone wants to cash out back to fiat. Do they need to convert back to the Etherium network and then sell? What happens to the locked value on the Etherium network? Of course if they want to cash out they can convert the &quot;Etherium&quot; token to Ada and cash out, but my question still stands as above.

                    <span>You may think the title is misleading, it&#x27;s not. 
 What I mean by relatives is that these two cryptocurrencies are derived from the same parent document. This document is cited at the bottom of Bitcoin&#x27;s Whitepaper and is linked here: http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt. Anyone is free to read the document (it&#x27;s fairly short) but I will leave my own observations below.
 The document is broken in two demonstrations for methods to create &quot;crypto-anarchy&quot; or a government free currency. 
 The first protocol describes Bitcoin with some prehistoric modifications: 
  
Creation of money via solving a previously unsolved computational problem.
 Transfer of money via broadcasting the transaction to everyone on the blockchain.
  
There is more general cryptocurrency ideas I&#x27;m choosing to skip over.
 This all makes sense considering the document is cited in Bitcoin&#x27;s wallpaper. But, then the author offers another protocol. 
  
Using &quot;servers&quot; linked by a Usenet-style broadcast channel instead of peer-to-peer. 
 I believe these resemble ADA&#x27;s Staking Pools
 
 The servers agree on the amount of money (ADA) to be created during each period (Epoch).
  
This post is nothing more than an observation I had while I was reading this document. Or maybe it was an applause to this author (who is unnamed) for his imagination and accuracy in 1998. With all this said, I stand with my statement that Cardano and Bitcoin are, in fact, relatives.

                    <span>Hey guys i just wrote an article on Cardano-node and cli tutorial. 
 https://medium.com/@NickFan34818768/cardano-node-cardano-cli-beginner-tutorial-e38fe67583ab
 These contains links or videos for those who might find it useful.
 Just thought i&#x27;d share and it may or may not help

                    <span>Has anyone ever overused monads and created bugs because of using them in an imperative style? If so, how did you get past that stage of your learning process? How can I try to use Monads more safely? This problem arose especially because of my use of the State monad.
 I feel like I went full circle with my FP understanding: Noob -&gt; Understands some -&gt; Understands Monads and has mind blown -&gt; Uses them -&gt; Blows up in face -&gt; is now scared -&gt; Noob

                    <span>hey everyone, I’m new here so idk if this has already been addressed in earlier posts but I’m a comp sci minor and I’m taking Haskell in the spring. I’ve taken python which I found decent and enjoyable but I’ve heard mixed reviews about Haskell. I’m taking another programming class but I know myself and once it starts getting harder I might fall behind since I heard Haskell is extremely hard to learn. 
 I have about a month before classes resume and would love to do something productive with my time. So I’m wondering if anyone knows any good platforms or sites that do a really good job at teaching Haskell.
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I am going through Typeclassopedia, and currently got stuck at the first set of exercises in the Monad section, namely the 3rd one:
  
Implement Functor and Monad instances for Free f, defined as data Free f a &#x3D; Var a | Node (f (Free f a)) You may assume that f has a Functor instance. This is known as the free monad built from the functor f.
  
I got the Functor instance for Free f, but with my Monad instance I am getting this error when trying to load it into ghci:
 • Could not deduce (Applicative (Free f)) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: Functor f bound by the instance declaration at Freemonad.hs:22:10-36 • In the instance declaration for ‘Monad (Free f)’ 
 My guess is that that&#x27;s due to this part in the monad definition in Control.Monad
  
class Applicative m &#x3D;&gt; Monad m where
  
which it seems like it wasn&#x27;t always there.
 So:
  
Is there some other way around it, or do I have to provide instance of Applicative for Free f first? Bonus question: should Typeclassopedia be updated to include this information?
 I can&#x27;t figure out how to implement Applicative for Free f, any hints?
  
In case it matters, here is my Monad instance, that I have convinced myself on paper that it should work
 instance Functor f &#x3D;&gt; Monad (Free f) where return &#x3D; Var (Var x) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; g &#x3D; g x (Node x) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; g &#x3D; Node $ (fmap.(flip (&gt;&gt;&#x3D;))) g x 
 but I have also tried implementation from this stackoverflow answer and got same error in ghci.

                    <span>I wrote a program in Emacs Lisp that turns a decimal number into a base-256 number. The numbers involved are very large, so here&#x27;s the logic of it, where base256 is an array of unicode characters, myNum is a number in the septenseptuagintacentillions, and output is an output variable initially set to nil:
  (while (&gt;&#x3D; myNum 1) (setq output (concat output (aref base256 (mod myNum 256)))) (setq myNum (truncate (/ myNum 256)))) 
 I want to rewrite it in Haskell, but I&#x27;m having some trouble. Obviously, I can&#x27;t use the same logic in Haskell, so here is what I have so far: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; -- Builds an array of integers by taking the modulus of each iteration of dividing a number by 256 buildNum num &#x3D; [mod x 256 | x &lt;- (iterate trunkDiv num)] where trunkDiv l &#x3D; truncate $ div l 256
 -- Create an array by accessing the item in my array of symbols that corresponds to a number in an array of integers mapNum nums syms &#x3D; [syms !! y | y &lt;- nums]
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn $ mapNum (buildNum myNum) base256 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Now, as far as I can tell, what I need is to stop iterating when the truncated product of my number and 256 reaches 1, but I don&#x27;t know where to even begin looking for that information.
 Could anybody give me some pointers on getting this to work?

                    <span>Renovate is used widely to help manage dependencies. Since this week was a short week for us at Caribou, two of us spent some time starting the work to add Haskell support https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/pull/13224. It needs help.
 If anyone is inclined to pick up where we left off, or start a brand new branch using some or all of what we did, please do! Please communicate your intent on the PR itself so if there are others who want to also work on it, you don&#x27;t have to duplicate their work.
 There&#x27;s another new tool in this same space, Stack Lint Extra Deps. The maintainer was kind enough to get on a phone call with us on Monday to discuss pros and cons of working on SLED vs Renovate, and the consensus is we&#x27;d all like to see Renovate support Haskell first. But Renovate is written in TypeScript and SLED is written in Haskell so if you&#x27;d like to help but don&#x27;t like/know TypeScript, SLED is a good candidate to hack on :D

                    <span>For those who are not aware, there are now 60k transactions on mainnet involving the MuesliSwap smart contract and over 100k ADA locked into it. The MuesliSwap contract is by far the most used smart contract on Cardano. DeFi is finally here! But please be careful when interacting with MuesliSwap since it&#x27;s a young project which has not yet been audited. Only risk the money you are willing to lose.

 Is there a good method for storing photos and/or text documents in the cardano chain?
 If not, other chains?
 I just like the idea of an absolutely immutable storage method for baby pictures, etc. Not necessarily concerned about keeping it Ft. Knox secure.

 It&#x27;s been a long Apeirogon week. Lots of successes, but also learnings! One of the biggest topics for Artano was, and still is KYC.
 We would love to hear your opinion about our KYC procedure, and KYC in general on Cardano and how we can improve it through this Google Form. 
 Thank you, we really appreciate your input and let us know if you have any specific questions in the comments. This is just the beginning of the KYC conversation on Cardano, and specifically how can we bank the unbanked AND abide to regulatory changes that are coming to the crypto world. 
 Here&#x27;s the form link, thank you very much and stay awesome!

                    <span>I&#x27;m seeing so many fud posts of people complaing about daedalus performance.
 Of course the correct answer is that if they are not a cryptoanarchist willing to sacrifice their computer performance for helping the health of the ecosystem and bickering about it instead, theay should jsut use a light wallet like a normal mainstream person. We will still probably have more than enough full nodes running around the world from people willuing to do that, so we don&#x27;t need everyone to do it.
 So even if recommending Daedalus to everyone might seem like a good idea helping the health of the network, it might be doing more damage than help in the adoption and make people who don&#x27;t realize the difference between light and full nodes hate Cardano. The light wallets exist for a reason. They might think this is the issie only with it because other blockchains are already past the point of recommending full nodes as the first options to everyone. Heck, most people have theirt bitcoin in custody already I think.
 So let&#x27;s stop putting Daedalus as the first recommended wallet, we should still mention it, but warn about it&#x27;s consequences and inform what using it means together with such recommendation. But for some reason, most tutorials for newbies on how to use Cardano only recommend Daedalus with no warnings or explanations. That&#x27;s just hurtful...
 There&#x27;s already enough fud as it is, we don&#x27;t need to shoot ourselves in the foot giving them even more ammo like this.

                    <span>UPDATE: this appears to be a general issue with counting transactions of an address. Not exactly sure which page counts what exactly still but it seems to be general for cardano addresses. It might be the difference of whether an address only counts outcoming vs. incoming and outcoming transactions. But I&#x27;d have to confirm this first. We should also think about what this implies when comparing contract volumes... 
 We have seen a stark rise in Smart Contract usage recently and I was curious how many transactions the most used Smart Contract so far had.
 I found MusliSwap, reporting that they had crossed 50k interactions recently on twitter:https://twitter.com/MuesliSwapTeam/status/1472740442999595014
 This seems reasonable, as only recently they were confirmed to be far ahead with only 30k interactions.
 Now I checked cardanoscan, the address they gave and can confirm that at the time of writing it is already beyond 50k (at 59k)https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1wy2mjh76em44qurn5x73nzqrxua7ataasftql0u2h6g88lc3gtgpz
 I wanted to cross-check and went to adapools...https://adapools.org/address/addr1wy2mjh76em44qurn5x73nzqrxua7ataasftql0u2h6g88lc3gtgpz
 They have already 74k transactions there. So they certainly crossed 50k and seem to have taken the minimum of both counts, which is very cool to see (a dApp truly coming to live!)
 But what still grinds my gears: How can this huge margin occur? Do the websites count differently? What could make the difference in the way they count?

                    <span>There is so much hype for good projects launching on cardano, so it just makes sense to start a good idea on this platform. On other blockchains the spotlight is often stolen by existing giants, and in ethereum&#x27;s case, L2s, whereas we here are keen to see what devs can come up with (anything that can give us the edge). Would like put some of those staked ada rewards to use.

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m Jeff, a long time member of the community. My days go back to a Cardano meeting with Sebastien at the Microsoft building in Seattle...2018.
 We are excited to announce a new project and are looking for team members to fill specific roles. 
 The project is focused around auctions for CNFT. We have a dynamite domain, web template and promotional talent onboard. There will be an evolution to support stakepools which will be announced at a later date. Very exciting
 We will also have a charity auction with more details to come. Community will vote where per auction. 
 All sales will have a portion dedicated to a lump sum to be awarded by the community chosen beneficiary. Lots of fun.
 The immediate opportunities:
 ✔️ Experience with HTML to edit and do updates to the site.
 ✔️Cardano smart contract dev
 ✔️Telegram, Twitter and other community interaction platform representative/ambassador
 Please message me if you are interested. Some folks have offered up front, but we wanted to share our opportunity to the community here. We will share in work and celebrate the $uccess together.
 Thank you and Happy Holiday! 
 Cheers,
 Jeff

Is there any library/research to help with this?

                    <span>Over the pandemic (and for one training session before it started), we have used a different set of materials for the Haskell 101 and Haskell 102 classes at Google. Although Haskell is not an officially supported language, this material was still presented to over 200 participants.
 The materials are available at https://github.com/google/haskell-trainings and any feedback is much appreciated.

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to learn how to use some ghc extensions with a simple multiplayer terminal based RPG and i would like to ask about creative ways to use extensions like TypeFamilies, KindSignatures, GADTs, DataKinds or TypeClasses to make some mechanic of RPG (like if an item is tradable so i can use functions that are related to selling and trading). 
 I thought about using DataKinds and KindSignatures to set if the Item can be used in trades and i thought about putting the class of a mage like if he is a Mage as a Phantom type. I dunno if it&#x27;s a dumb but i want to learn creative ways to enforce some properties.
 What are the cool mechanics that u can enforce using types in Haskell? :)

                    <span>Hello, i just started to be a good citizen and write some regression tests for my code.
 Considering i have some error-type and a function that might result in an error:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell newtype Username &#x3D; Username{unUsername::Text} data UsernameError &#x3D; ErrorNameLength | ErrorNameIllegalCharacter
 -- smart constructor for username newUsername :: Text -&gt; Either LoginError Username newUsername name &#x3D; ... -- inspects argument and might return Left &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 in my HUnit test, how would I assert that e.g. newUsername with &quot;&quot; results in ErrorNameLength?
 My thoughts is to do it with pattern matching in do notation, relying on the MonadFail instance of IO. While this works, i see that HUnits assertion-functions allow to provide a descriptive error message in case of failure.
 Therefore I am questioning wether this would be the correct way.

                    <span>Initially i was suggested to write haskell code in Latex by Minted Package. But when i am compiling this code
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;\documentclass[12pt]{article}
 \usepackage{minted} \begin{document} \begin{minted}{haskell} --type Stack a &#x3D; [a] --push :: Stack a -&gt; a -&gt; Stack a --push xs x &#x3D; x:xs
 --pop :: Stack a -&gt; (a, Stack a) --pop [] &#x3D; error &quot;Empty List&quot; --pop (x:xs) &#x3D; (x, xs)
 data Stack a &#x3D; Stack [a] instance Show a &#x3D;&gt; Show (Stack a) where show (Stack [a]) &#x3D; show [a]
 push :: Stack a -&gt; a -&gt; Stack a push (Stack xs) x &#x3D; Stack (x:xs)
 pop :: Stack a -&gt; (a,Stack a) pop (Stack xs) | null xs &#x3D; error &quot;Empty List&quot; | otherwise &#x3D; (head xs, Stack xs)
 \end{minted} \end{document} &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 It was showing the error
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; line 3: Package minted Error: You must invoke LaTeX with the -shell-escape flag. \begin
 line 3: Emergency stop. \begin{document}
  : shell escape is disabled, so I can only detect \ifwindows. 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Why it is happening and how to overcome it ?

                    <span>In my continued attempt to get mstksg&#x27;s AOC template working, I temporarily gave up on my MacOS attempt (thanks again /u/simonmic for the help so far!) and switched to my Linux box. After a long failure trying to use apt-get install haskell-platform and getting unfixable (by me) dependency errors, I switched to using ghcup (why do we even have haskell-platform if it&#x27;s not going to work?), and things seem to be compiling and running.
 But now I have some (hopefully basic) questions. - The &quot;Interactive&quot; section of the documentation says I should be able to import an AOC.Run.Interactive package. I do not see how to do this. Where / how do I run ghci to import this? I can see the Haskell file in src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs, but import AOC.Run.Interactive fails with ghci run in either the top level or down in src. If I :l src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs I get Illegal lambda-case (use LambdaCase), but I didn&#x27;t think that was the right thing in the first place. I assume I&#x27;m missing something simple and obvious here? - The &quot;Executable&quot; section of the documentation says I should be able to get a plain old runnable executable aoc-dev. How do I get this? Right now I&#x27;m using cabal run aoc-dev run 1 a for instance. (If I do build an executable, do I need to rebuild it when I change a day&#x27;s solution?)
 As always any help is most appreciated.

                    <span>A couple of weeks ago Nix 2.4 was
released. This
was the first release in more than two years. More than 195
individuals contributed to this release. Since Tweag is the biggest
contributor to the Nix project, I’d like to highlight some of the
features that Tweag has worked on.

Flakes
Flakes are a new format to package Nix-based projects in a more
discoverable, composable, consistent and reproducible way. A flake is
just a repository or tarball containing a file named flake.nix that
specifies dependencies on other flakes and returns any Nix assets such
as packages, Nixpkgs overlays, NixOS modules or CI tests.
You can read more about flakes in the following blog posts:

                    <span>Twice a year — in May and November, nixpkgs maintainers and
contributors get together to fix as many build failures as possible
for the new release. The event is, as per tradition, called Zero Hydra
Failures, or ZHF for short.
This year, me and fellow hacker cab404
had organized a hackathon to help the cause and spread the Nix love
around. The basic premise was, quoting cab404:
Go—go—go!
We wanted to fix as many builds as possible, right before the
branchoff. Fixing the broken builds would allow NixOS 21.11 to have a more complete package
set.
The main point of this post is to share the experience with people
looking to organize similar events.

In this post, we will attempt to demystify this constraint solving process, as well as review
a few aspects of type-family reduction, to facilitate the development of type-checking plugins.
This post will serve as a reference, when we start writing our own type-checking plugins in Part III.
Don’t worry: you don’t need to know everything before you start writing your own plugins!
It’s only when debugging a type-checking plugin that the rubber hits the road:
a few skills become rather important, such as the ability to understand the different types of constraints,

                    <span>Although the feature is still marked as experimental, the release of Nix 2.4 marks the entry of content-addressed derivations in a released Nix version.
This is something to celebrate, but also an occasion to look back and see what this addition means, implementation wise.
This new feature required indeed some deep changes both in the high-level algorithm describing the build loop (and also as a consequence in its low-level details) as well as in the “plumbing” code around it.
Note: Because it touches the implementation, this post will be more technical than the others, and will also assume that you’re somewhat familiar with what content-addressed derivations means, and how it works. If you haven’t done it already, I invite you to read the previous blog articles on the topic (1, 2 and 3), …</span>

                    <span>Recently, a group of Haskellers within Tweag had a knowledge-sharing event
where we shared our varied Haskell setups with each other, and learned some
nice tricks and tips for every-day life.
The idea was raised of sharing these findings via the blog, so without further
ado, let’s explore the varieties of the Tweag Haskelling experience by
covering a few of our personal setups!

Other main tools: grep, cabal,
inotify/entr around cabal build all, my own prototype tags generator.
Explanation: barebones emacs &#x3D; syntax highlighting + basic Haskell mode for minimal indentation suggestions + a hack of gtags.el for querying my Tweag tags db
I love: fast start-up, tags for instance declarations, tags only require parse not typecheck, never hangs, never crashes, all sta…</span>
