                    <span>In the past couple of months I have noticed much more difficulty having my taps on links in Chrome iOS register. I&#x27;ll tap the same link multiple times with no response whatsoever. When this happens scrolling the page a bit and retrying does seem to help. I would estimate that about a third of my initial taps fail to register. This is on the main article links as well as the harder to hit tiny links for comment, upvote, etc. I have no idea if this is an issue with recent updates to iOS, Chrome or this site. It has been quite frustrating. Has anyone else been experiencing this?

                    <span>Hello, noob in the cardano space here.
 As I understood, NFTs are native to cardanos, meaning you don&#x27;t need a smart contract to mint them, how exactly do marketplaces like cnft work then?
 Let&#x27;s say I want to mint 20 nfts (images), and I want to do it manually, without any third party using cardano sdk, what would be the total fee for it?
 Would I be able to sell my nfts on cnft if I did it manually?

                    <span>I&#x27;d like to remind folks that, with a lot on the line in the US, India, and in other large countries where regulation could easily go crypto-sour, we need to stick together.
 Every chain makes different trade-offs with respect to speed, centralization, and security (the Buterin &quot;Trilemma&quot;), and each ecosystem has different preferences about speed and methods of development. In the end, multiple chains will likely survive, along with a number of central bank digital currencies. And there may be overlap (e.g., a number of CBDCs may leverage an existing blockchain or its code to jumpstart themselves). There&#x27;s no need to put anyone down, unless they are committing outright fraud or maliciously obstructing progress.
 Investors and community participants should also take care to match their preferences up with those of the ecosystems they participate in. For example, people who want to move fast, break things, and see fast returns should definitely stay away from Cardano. Cardano is better for the slow, steady planners and thinkers.
 My point is that there is room for all of us here. The real adversaries are people like bad actors, governments that fear loss of control, and investors who put money into a chain that didn&#x27;t match their expectations. Let&#x27;s go easy on each other.

                    <span>Dear all,
 I am looking for a super easy way to store some information in the Cardano blockchain about the engagement with my fiancé and (as a separate transaction) some other information about our marriage. The information should be viewable via a the Cardano explorer or another blockexplorer. Instead of just saving the raw information (e.g. using https://cardanowall.com/en/), there should be a way to let the information be signed by both me and my fiancé. After initial research, I found that https://github.com/sdlck/cardano-utils/blob/master/address-data-decoder/addrDecode.py could be a good solution (create new Cardano address with encoded information in it and signing of the information by me and my fiancé by sending some ADAs to the addresss). However, I assume that the information would not be viewable via the explorer with this method, right? Therefore, I think I will need a smart contract to achieve this, right?
 THANK YOU FOR ANY HINTS!

                    <span>Key Takeaways from this article:
  
Cardano has a lot more in store for investors and users.
 Its ultimate goal is to become a self-sustaining system.
 Cardano may truly skyrocket as the network expands and work to reach its goal.
 May want to consider selling a very high-risk name and reallocating the cash into Cardano. 
 The network already is showing its usefulness in industries from education to healthcare.
 Has speed advantage compared to Ethereum.
 Cardano upgrades happen after peer review that limits potential flaws.
 Cardano’s five stages of development are encouraging.
 All cryptocurrencies involve a decent amount of risk.
 You should never invest more in crypto than you can afford to lose. 
 If you favor Cardano over riskier meme coins then you may gain over the long term.

                    <span>I have been a long time ADA fan. I bought before the Shelly upgrade and I couldn&#x27;t even stake because my Exchanged took long to upgrade their wallet and I couldn&#x27;t withdraw. So I&#x27;ve been here long.
 So you guys can imagine, when Yoroi came out, staking and then the run up to native assets and smart contracts. I am in heaven and loving ADA. I am also a developer and ADA is my main blockchain.
 That being said, I haven&#x27;t executed a smart contract or held other tokens in my Yoroi wallet. And a few days ago, I decided it was time.
 Currently, there aren&#x27;t many tokens and Dexes and I don&#x27;t want to throw 1000 ADA into some NFT. So I bought 20 ADA of Hosky on their Dex. Their Dex is a very simple orderbook system. I actually don&#x27;t know how orders are matched but you can also match with other orde…</span>

                    <span>It is true that for now you need to learn some basic Haskell to develop on Cardano Platform but that is not a negative in my mind. We hear about all these scam coins like Squid Game and all those Doge meme coins. Guess what they are all build on Ethereum or BNC platforms. They not only give them a bad name, but they also clutter, slowdown and sometimes overwhelm the transaction of the whole echo system. Do I even need to bring up the Crypto Kitties to prove my point.
 The fact that it takes more time, effort and knowledge to build on Cardano for the time being is a great deterrent for those shitty, scammy projects to stay away from this newly developed echo system. IT will have less wanna be, 5 minute, money hungry only projects attracted to the space then others. We have seen that already. Sundaeswap has delayed its original ICO due to questions and concerns from investors and Cardano community at large. It seems to me that those involved in building on Cardano network find transparency and quality more important then just obtaining funding and short term success. They seem to adopt the building and developing priorities from Cardano team, which always chose product quality over profits. 
 Cardano network as a whole, will attract new blood into the echo system, with new inspiration, ambition and hard working ethics, developers that will become the future in this space. There was almost 10 billion dollars stolen just in last 12 months by bad project build by people with bad intentions, pretending to be great innovator. I believe the temporary barriers that Haskell offers will prevent those kid of project to be build on Cardano platform which might just be the thing we need to make it the most reliable and quality focus platform out there.

                    <span>Do I understand it right guys ? I read somewhere that while Cardano is using UTXO model, You can stake Your Cardano just right before epoch end and You will get your reward, meaning You do not need to stake all 5 days, but just before epoch end. What made me think, Am I able to farm with my Cardano (when farms will be ready) for 4 days and then stake in a pool on the fifth day to get my staking reward ? If so then it will be something awesome. :)

 Jet is a structural editor for JSON.
 That is, it&#x27;s an editor which is aware of the structure of JSON and allows you to manipulate it directly. As a result, the document is always in a valid state. 
 $ cabal update &amp;&amp; cabal install jet $ jet my.json 
 Hit &#x27;?&#x27; for the key bindings. Maybe back up any important files first. 
 Give it a go and let me know what you think https://github.com/ChrisPenner/jet
 ​
 The implementation uses a zipper over a Cofree tree, which should be pretty adaptable to most recursive structures (e.g. ASTs). You can find the Cofree Zipper here: https://github.com/ChrisPenner/recursive-zipper#readme
 ​
 To head off the &quot;just use a text-editor&quot; comments; yes, you should probably just use a text editor. This was mainly written as a research exercise for more complex structural editors, and also because I couldn&#x27;t find many good resources on writing structural editors and wanted to see what the abstractions might look like. Hopefully you enjoy the experiment as much as I enjoyed writing it 😄
 ​
 Cheers!

                    <span>I have two questions one involves type inference and the other involves reflection.
  
1. Template Haskell vs type inference
 I&#x27;m using refinement types from the refined library and template haskell refinement refineTH. For example I have these following definitions, the unrefined type: 
 data UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a &#x3D; UnrefinedStandardCurveDef { prime_s :: a, aCoeff_s :: a, bCoeff_s :: a, generator_s :: (a, a), order_s :: NN.Integer, cofactor_s :: NN.Integer } deriving Lift 
 the refinement types:
 data StandardCurveDefValidator instance (Typeable a, Integral a) &#x3D;&gt; Predicate StandardCurveDefValidator (UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a) where validate pred def &#x3D; ... type RefinedStandardCurveDef&#x27; a &#x3D; Refined StandardCurveDefValidator (UnrefinedStandardCurveDef a) newtype RefinedStandardCurveD…</span>

                    <span>Hello, I come here to ask for help after about 8 frustrating hours trying to solve this exercise, so please help me figure this out.
 I am trying to recursively look in a list of pairs where one element of the pair is a product and the second element is 2 numbers representing its position on the shelves [ (meat,(4,5)) , (soap,(6,7)) , (wine,(4.3)) ] and verify if in any situation I end up with 2 products on the same spot on the shelf.
 ​
 Basically I dont care what the product is, my only concern is that 2 things dont end up trying to be restocked on the same position on the shelves.
 ​
 I have the shelves and the products set has data types so for example I know that Products can only be Milk, Wine, Soap, Eggs, Butter....like 10 more, and That ShelfPos is (Int,Int).
 ​
 What I have been trying to do is has requested on the exercise.
 ​
 positionIsFree :: [(Products, ShelfPos)] -&gt; Bool
 ​
 positionIsFree [ ] &#x3D; True
 positionIsFree (( products, shelfpos) : [ ] ) &#x3D; True
 positionIsFree (( p, (x,y)) : ( p2, (x2,y2)) : t) | x &#x3D;&#x3D; x2 &amp;&amp; y &#x3D;&#x3D; y2 &#x3D; False
 --------(reddit formating is hard)---------------| otherwise &#x3D; positionIsFree ((p, (x,y)) : t )
 ​
 This works for the first pair, it runs the list and sees if it causes any conflict. If it doesnt Id like to restart the process with the second pair. The problem I am runing in is whenever I finish doing this I cant restart again since I trew away all my list on the otherwise step.
 I tried to do this backwards, like always comparing the last element, but I end up runing into a types problem where it says it expects a Bool and is getting a list.
 ​
 Thank you for your time reading this.

                    <span>Today has been wild. I am quite shocked at how quickly the whole thing happened and how difficult it is to report the hacked account to instagram and try recover the account. The docs seem to take you in a loop without ever being able to resolve the problem...
My friends instagram account has only ~2,000 followers, so not even a huge amount, and her email and password was reset about 6pm to a gmail account, and by midnight the account had already posted deep-faked AI videos of her promoting cryptocurrency scams.
The deepfake videos are very realistic too, if I hadn&#x27;t know her better or know about the hacking it would be very easy to believe it was real...
It&#x27;s possible they deep-faked her videos ahead of time but it seems like something you&#x27;d only spend resources on only if you knew the attack was successful.
And there doesn&#x27;t seem to be that much news or content online about this happening or it seems very targeted... but for such an account with such a small following it seems like it must be quite widespread problem.
Have you had this happen to someone you know personally and what do you think about how prepared we are to deal with scams this sophisticated or what effect they might have?

                    <span>I have been searching for a solution to e-sign some lease agreements. It is something that I need to do maybe once a year and the only thing I need is a legally binding way to put signatures and timestamps on a PDF.  I do not need any fancy features.
I was doing research, and it seems like most document signature companies all charge monthly subscription fees! This does not work for me as I am not using the platform on a monthly basis.
Are there free, open source alternatives to Docusign? If so, why do more companies not use them?

                    <span>Hey guys I love cardano and what they are doing. While I understand it has its issues I don&#x27;t understand why there is so much hate for it with statements that are sweeping generalizations and severe misunderstandings? 
 I understand the legitimate concerns but I see so much Needless hate on Twitter and Reddit that seems to just be random. Can someone help me understand because I don&#x27;t get it. 
 Are people just upset that they aren&#x27;t making a huge return? Do they not know that that this is a long term game with cardano given how they operate? 
 It doesn&#x27;t feel like regular critique. It sometimes feels like people are just ignorant and just want to say something mean/ very false. It also seems like most of the comments like that are not done with any research just opinion. 
 Is this just me?

 It has put a lot of time into building real-world partnerships and use cases.

                    <span>A new blog post by IOHK describes a 3-tier pricing model for prioritizing transactions: https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/26/network-traffic-and-tiered-pricing/
 Here&#x27;s a TLDR (pls correct me of I&#x27;m wrong):
 Transactions in each block are split up in fair (50%), balanced (30%), immediate (20%) tiers, where prices of &quot;balanced&quot; and &quot;immediate&quot; are updated dynamically to reach the target fraction of block occupancy. 
 Transactions in the &quot;Fair&quot; tier are prioritized based on age and content of transaction.
 Users can specify a maximum transaction price and pay only the minimum amount necessary to complete the transaction at the desired priority (price payed depends on congestion). 
 I think this is a good way of providing stable and fair fees while still allowing for prioritizing time-critical transactions. 
 What do you think? Do you see any problems with this approach?

                    <span>How do you guys run your Daedalus (hard node)? Several questions I can think are:
  
Which OS do you use?; Windows? Linux? Mac?
 Which device do you use?; Laptop? Tower? Desktop? Server? Mini PCs?
 Do you have any tips? Particular issues? Share any.

 I am rather geeky, so I try a lot of different stuff. I have run it on Mac OS, Windows 10, Ubuntu, and now am thinking about the Docker container.

                    <span>Muesli Swap claims to have just launched the first Dex on Cardano.
 https://ada.muesliswap.com/
 This is a beta version of the project so connect at your own risk. I put a little money in to play around and here’s what I’ve found…
 The project requires you to use Nami wallet to transact. I created a new wallet in Nami and connected it to the protocol. They have a pre launch where you can buy their utility token, Milk, at a rate of 10 Milk to 1 ADA… I went ahead and tested the feature and Milk did show up in my wallet at the expected ratio. In their own words:
 MILK is the token that powers the MuesliSwap ecosystem. The core benefits of MILK are:
 Priority trading: access to exclusive exchange features
 Governance: Vote on community proposals
 Staking: Participate in the new MILK pools and …</span>

                    <span>Hey Gang,
 New guy perspective here..
 I bought a shit ton of Cardano this year ( $24,000 ) at an average cost of $1.12
 Like everyone, I was thrilled when it hit over $3 bucks.
 I&#x27;ve been staking it and rarely look at the rewards.
 ​
 I also own tons more of other crypto.. and believe me, I&#x27;ve made much more on that.
 But there&#x27;s something special about Cardano..
 The community..
 Charlies..
 The mission..
 This is why I haven&#x27;t sold. 
 I read other forums/YT chats where people are jumping ship.
 So be it..
 ​
 Sometimes you need to set profits aside and hold what you believe will be better for the world in the long run.
 ​
 Be safe friends.. our time will come.

 its something that has been an issue from the beginning. and even tho i selected a different drive in the setup, it still chose c://

                    <span>I’ve tried looking into this question, and so far I understand that using overloaded strings and strictness are good ways to improve performance. However, I don’t understand how fast Haskell is relative to other languages. Some claim that it is slower than Python; others claim that it can be as fast as or faster than C. The programming language benchmark game suggests that Haskell is roughly as fast as Java and C#, but this is complicated by the extensive use of foreign libraries in those languages. 
 What does this subreddit think?

.el {
  will-change: opacity;

                    <span>Greetings fellow crypto enthusiasts. I am excited that Cardano has achieved smart contract capabilities. As a community, we should be vigilant of projects seeking to build on the network by supporting authentic ones and exposing fake ones. In that light, I come to you to share my research on the AADA project. 
 When seeking to verify the authenticity, seriousness, and overall quality of a project, it is important to get to know the team members. The following is taken from the AADA website 
 \&quot;AADA Team\&quot; image taken from https://aada.finance/
 A quick search on LinkedIn for the first name, Mantas Adriuska yields the following:
 LinkedIn Mantas Andriuska No results found
 The LinkedIn link for Mantas on the AADA website leads here: 
 LinkedIn Mantas Andriuska No picture
 Scrolling down through Mantas Andriuska&#x27;s LinkedIn page there are several comments from Asif Iqbal 
 Asif Iqbal&#x27;s comment
 Asif&#x27;s LinkedIn shows the following 
 Asif Iqbal Contact Info
 The Personal Website leads to the following: 
 https://asifiqbal.rocks/
 Moving on.
 For the second name there is a match:
 LinkedIn Aidas Klimas
 Aidas&#x27; &quot;Personal website&quot; link leads to a yellow page portal with a single link that leads to the &quot;Company Website&quot; link. Which claims &quot;Daily lunch and business menu in one place. Every day, Kasvalgyt.lt presents the latest daily lunch offers in your city.&quot; But has no functionality. 
 Given the first two team members&#x27; lack of substance, and an additional inconsistency with Aidas&#x27; LinkedIn experience as the &quot;Chief Technology Officer&quot; against the AADA.finance website as &quot;Cardano Developer #2&quot; I have serious doubts about the authenticity of this project and am not convinced it is real.
 LinkedIn Klimas as CTO
 Nothing here adds up. I am highly skeptical of this.
 TLDR: AADA appears to be a scam. Please DYOR, but if you are so inclined to share your research, it helps the community.

 Release date: 26 November 2021
 Daedalus 4.5.2 is a maintenance release to address two problems related to Cardano node management. In some Windows machines, the node did not start, and for a subset of users on all platforms, the node did not close until the process was killed.

                    <span>so i have made a lot of cnft trades in recent months over a few wallets. the utxo model is great and all but makes understanding whats income and profit a nightmare, ie with all the added transactions in change. cnft.io is also a nightmare of whats the original cost vs profits.
 i tried koinly but it doesnt seem to get ada in terms of profits and losses. is there any tax related software that currently works for cardano wallets ? especially when it comes to cnfts and cnft.io

 How do we do the same thing with Cardano?
 I see that Daedalus is a desktop wallet and Yoroi a mobile wallet, that can transfer ADA only.

That&#x27;s gonna be huge for example look up #adapad and #astroswap and you&#x27;ll see why I don&#x27;t dare part with it! Defi has finally come to the Cardano Network!

                    <span>Anyone else who would like a function in the wallets we use for Cardano that enables us to plan and execute stake delegation from epoch x current pool to epoch y new pool?
 ​
 For example - I am currently staking in Meld 7. After epoch 307 I will no longer recieve rewards from Meld for staking in Meld 7. Because of that, I would like to move my stake in Meld 7 to Flickto in epoch 308. Basically a tool for assigning my wallets delegated stake by epoch.
 ​
 A simple UI where I can select an epoch and then assign a pool to that epoch would be sufficient. Dont know how far into the future one should be able to do this, but a year or so seems reasonable.
 ​
 A tool like this in the wallet would only become more useful as more and more ISO will take place on Cardano. It would save alot of hassle of remembering dates and planning so you will be able to perform the stake pool switch at the right epoch.
 ​
 I would ofc be fine with spending my ADA for all the planned transactions upon submitting the &quot;stake plan&quot; and then spend the fee again later if I changed my mind and wanted to switch pools or epochs. Because you know, this is Cardano - not Ethereum :P
 ​
 Other wallets enhancements that I derived out of comments here:
 -A notification when the conditions of a pool you have staked with changes. For example: Reached saturation, pool closing, % changes etc.
 -Make it possible to write notes/comments on epochs as a quick reminder/note to self.
 ​
 What do you guys think?

 I&#x27;m writing right now NES JIT compiler for fast emulation. I want to interact with SDL interface and other emulated devices such as graphics, sound or game input, so I guess I need to do some foreign calls to Haskell from LLVM. 
 How to do that properly?

                    <span>I’m preparing for this year’s Advent of Code by working on last year’s problems. I am very new to Cabal, having learnt it this week, and am practising problem solving and project organisation on day 4’s problem. You’ll find my Cabal project for day 4 here.
 Here’s the issue. I discovered that HLS no longer flags erroneous code in VS Code. However, it still gives me suggestions on what to do.
 In my Main.hs there is a deliberately-incorrect function called test. I used it to see what was going on with HLS.
 test :: Int -&gt; Int test x &#x3D; show x 
 In my Cabal project, HLS only suggested that I refactor the definition using eta reduction. It did not say anything about a mismatched return type. When I created a random Haskell file outside Cabal, HLS worked as expected and showed me both messages.
 Here are further details in case they are useful:
  
macOS 12.0.1 Monterey
 VS Code 1.62 (with Haskell extension 1.7.1)
 GHC 8.10.7 (installed using ghcup)
 Cabal 3.6.2.0 (installed using ghcup)
 HLS 1.5.0 (installed using ghcup)
  
How might I resolve this?

                    <span>Hello all! As part of my preparation for doing Advent of Code this Christmas, I&#x27;ve decided that I want to approach it more as a project than as a pile of disconnected one-off solutions. In this vein, I am curious as to what the current best practices are around Haskell software packages. Is it stack? Is it nix? Is it ... something else?
 I&#x27;ll be working on macOS, and I&#x27;ve been writing software a long time, but I consistently bounce off of Haskell and I&#x27;d love to be more conversant in it, as there is a lot about Haskell that I really enjoy.
 Anyway, TIA!

                    <span>I&#x27;m a fairly experienced developer who uses TypeScript professionally and working in space/defense field but seeing Haskell as something that could help me level up.
 What video resources would you recommend to someone who wants to learn Haskell?

                    <span>Bellroy helps people carry better by making great bags, phone cases, and wallets. We’re Australia’s Best Place to Work (&lt; 100 employees category), we’ve grown rapidly, and we’re now looking to expand our Technology Team to keep pace with that ongoing growth. We’re not a software company, but software development is one of our core competencies. This means the Technology Team rarely works to hard delivery deadlines (we prioritise “correct” over “now”) and we regularly make open-source contributions.
 We have about 40KLOC of backend Haskell code supporting our systems, and we&#x27;re looking for two more Haskell developers who can balance shipping features with improving this codebase every time they change it. While we&#x27;re not afraid of the occasional inelegant hack, we&#x27;d much prefer to look back…</span>

 Tn at dinner my adorable grandmother got somewhat tipsy and tried to demonstrate for us how she sings the new Chinese song in her choir without actually knowing the words. So she takes a big deep breath and starts belting CHING YEE CHONG and my aunt immediately goes MOM YOU CANT DO THAT and the entire table just erupted into laughter for like five minutes straight. I cried real tears

                    <span>TL;DR Cardano allows me to become my own micro lending institution.
 I saw an interview Charles did in which he described the lending rates in African countries, the interest rates seem very high even when compared to my own native payday loan style lending businesses.
 (I live in the US).
 Link to that interview here: https://youtu.be/5-vsuU-OIhI
 So as I understand it, crypto currencies allow the transfer of value across vast distances more efficiently than traditional lending institutions. Due to this technological advantage, their business model allows them to provide a service to a demographic of people who are seen as non-viable clients to traditional banks, the un-banked. However, these emerging markets have access to cell phones and global telecommunication systems which puts them in the same realm as me, a rando in the US with some dollars that I don&#x27;t immediately need for anything. So, rather than leave this money in a savings account, which gives me back little to nothing. I&#x27;ve used some of my liquidity to buy some ADA in the hopes that eventually, Cardano will become a major player in the world of micro-finance for the &quot;developing world.&quot; News about their deals in Africa give me much encouragement as these are the places that would greatly benefit from stable currencies.
 Essentially, I think of it like Uber, which connects people that need rides with people that have cars. Cardano connects people who have liquidity with people that need money. Yes, the blockchain will take its cut, but it will loan money to the un-banked at a less predatory rate than they currently have access to and will give me a higher return on my money than a savings account. Am I wrong in thinking this way? Help me understand.

                    <span>So I started to research some opportunities to invest in DEX and DeFi on cardano before they go live.
 I stumbled upon multiple posts here that mention SundaeSwap as one of the potential winners. Then I tried to make my research and the result puzzled me quite a bit.
 First of all on the official site team consists of 1 lead engineer, 1 smart contract engineer and 3 frontend engineers. I&#x27;m a software engineer myself and it seems that it&#x27;s really not enough to develop such a big project that implies a lot of backend work. I guess this page could be outdated though.
 So I started to look at their github repositories and I could not find any smart contract that should be deployed to cardano network. Also I don&#x27;t see a lot of activity in the repositories and most of them are just forks (copies) of the other open source code. From what I&#x27;ve seen it doesn&#x27;t seem to me that the release date is close.
 So here is the questions part. Does anyone have any additional info about the progress? Maybe I overlooked some information or found a wrong repository.
 What do you think?

                    <span>What is the research behind this voting system? Isn&#x27;t this basically saying that the rich people get more say in how things evolve? Isn&#x27;t this a problem when the rich favor changes that benefit themselves? Alternatively, I doubt we want every wallet to be 1 vote either. That&#x27;s also easy to manipulate.
 I would love to see some of the peer reviewed research that has gone into this voting system

                    <span>Hello people,
 I&#x27;ve just moved to Nairobi, Kenya and would love to connect with like-minded Cardano fans here. I&#x27;ve been working in energy access for the last 4 years in East Africa, so I know the area pretty well but more recent to the blockchain space. Here to learn, meet cool people and even see if there are opportunities for bringing off-grid solar projects onto the blockchain. Any advice / recommendations appreciated.

                    <span>To put it short: Cardano&#x27;s team puts quality over quantity.
 Developing on ADA is hard, because the code is difficult to master and other crypto currencies are easier to work with, that&#x27;s why many developers choose to not work on ADA.
 ​
 Is that a bad sign? Absolutely not, because Cardano has different goals than other crypto currencies. Their goal is it to work with countries, banks and companies - not small DeFi or DApp developers.
 Meaning the whole development on ADA goes slower, but it&#x27;s safer, better for professional use and to put it simply: future proof

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a Haskell Gemini server framework. Everything seems to be working fine, except that I&#x27;m having trouble reading the client certificate when it&#x27;s sent. I had to do some admittedly janky things to get it in the first place.
 If anyone is familiar with the tls or tcp-streams packages and can tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong, that would be appreciated.
 My code is located on Codeberg, and the most likely relevant functions are Network.Gemini.Capsule.listenLoop and Network.Gemini.Capsule.adjustServerParams.

                    <span>I&#x27;m a fairly new Haskeller (~1 year) and I&#x27;ve been getting into graphical programming with Haskell using various C bindings like X11, GTK, and OpenGL/GLFW. And while the bindings seem the be very mature and capable, they tend to have me writing in an imperative way (a lot of do blocks for callbacks and such), probably a reality of being bound to imperative languages.
 This got me wondering if it&#x27;s possible to do graphical programming in Haskell sans any bindings at all. If so are there any projects that attempt to do this? The closest thing I&#x27;ve found so far is GPipe, which promises an alternative to the imperative style of OpenGL, but seems to be built on the OpenGL bindings itself.

                    <span>Hey everyone, can you help me to create a function that creates a complete list of coordinates ((0,0) to (x,y)) from the largest coordinate? I would appreciate.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve done a lot of OO programming and get the mental model of objects representing bits of state and methods representing ways to enact changes on that state.
 However I&#x27;m having a hard time getting my head around Haskell (I&#x27;ve just started). I get the idea of no side effects and I get the idea of pure functions, but I still can&#x27;t grok how to such a language can have state that exists for the duration of a program.
 Let&#x27;s say an object that is created at the start and over time the objects state changes. For instance a chess board. How can I stop recreating a new object (let&#x27;s says it&#x27;s large), in every function call?
 Edit: thank you everyone. I&#x27;ve got some answers which have really made my thinking much much clearer.

                    <span>Recently, a group of Haskellers within Tweag had a knowledge-sharing event
where we shared our varied Haskell setups with each other, and learned some
nice tricks and tips for every-day life.
The idea was raised of sharing these findings via the blog, so without further
ado, let’s explore the varieties of the Tweag Haskelling experience by
covering a few of our personal setups!

                    <span>I’m a CEO with very limited free time/capacity. I would love to recruit someone to help out with “everything else” — that means personal tasks first and foremost, but involvement with the administrative/day-to-day tasks in my business too.
Whilst I’ve recruited and managed plenty of “traditional” roles in the office, this area is new to me.
Has anyone hired a PA/EA before, who can share any tips or advice?
Thanks!

                    <span>I am a fairly new investor. I joined the Crypto market at the end of October 2021. 
 Naturally, I looked at Bitcoin then thought, Nah I missed the train on this one. I needed something that was going to make me lots of money in the medium to long term. I looked at Bitcash and was convinced it was it, only because I imagined that the value would climb up to the current price of BTC. I logged on to Paypal to buy it but for some reason, they would not accept my card payment. After several attempts, I gave up and went to bed. I was destined for something else :)
 The next day I watched a few videos about Crypto and discovered there is more to cryptocurrency than Bitcoin. I looked into the top 20 altcoins and discovered Cardano ADA. I was impressed with the vision, the peer-to-peer review, the …</span>

                    <span>Now more than ever I realize that what Charles was talking about is not just relevant but an imperative change needed for the countries prone to destabilization. 
 Having the entire student body of Ethiopia, be at risk of losing their academic achievements in the span of days really is eye opening. I hope the system gets put in place before anything bad happens.

                    <span>The market is just playing out the cycle.
 Collective human psychology, emotion and intent (sentiment) when working within the confines of a specific ruleset (the market) plays out to predictable results on the longer term in fairly demonstrable fashion.
 Trading bots and algorithms ultimately are working within the same ruleset that is underpinned by that collective sentiment. That is, they don&#x27;t push the the market sentiment much outside of what you&#x27;d consider a fairly benign tolerance level.
 Natural updates, news items or events sometimes push the next big price move further along the timeline or indeed bring it closer to the present but beyond a black swan event specific to the market and/or that specific tech/stock/commodity these things largely play out in their predictive human patterns on the longer view.
 So, Cardano price is... just playing out.
 Catch the 4+4 correlation points below, where do you think this is going next?
 Cardano Price 1Y USD
  
Did you buy Cardano because you thought it was going to Zero? No
 Did you buy Cardano because you thought it was crap technology with no future? No
  
So with those two things in mind, as a genuine question, what are you worried about?
 If you &#x27;NEED&#x27; the money now, then you shouldn&#x27;t have invested the money in the first place.
 Sit back, buy some more, or hold what you have, or sell what you have, it&#x27;s your prerogative but know this - no-one got rich by buying, panicking and then selling on that panic, no one.

 Bitstamp is based in Luxemburg and regulated . https://www.bitstamp.net/about-us/

 Charles drops a video on the eToro delisting. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same p…</span>

                    <span>Hi everyone! I&#x27;m a beginner at Haskell and this is my first question. I figured out how to make things work myself and asking this just to understand Haskell better and improve my code.
 I want to write a file, but its path might exist already so I want to find a free path by adding numbers to the path. E.g. if I already have &quot;foo.txt&quot; then I want to write to &quot;foo 1.txt&quot;, then &quot;foo 2.txt&quot; and so on.
 So I wrote this function:  findFreeName :: FilePath -&gt; IO FilePath findFreeName path &#x3D; head  filterM isPathFree (map makePathWithNumber [1, 2 ..]) where -- skipping implementation here: isPathFree :: FilePath -&gt; IO Bool -- uses the path parameter and turns x to &quot;foo x.txt&quot; unless x is 0 makePathNumber :: Int -&gt; FilePath  And it started to check paths &quot;foo.txt&quot;, &quot;foo 1.txt&quot;, &quot;foo 2.txt&quot; and …</span>

                    <span>Working with the REPL, I just tried this
 mylist1 &#x3D; [1,2,3] 
 then I was foolish enough to do this
 mylist1 &#x3D; -2 : -1 : 0 : mylist1 
 then
 mylist1 
 The result was runaway recursion that I could stop (I&#x27;m in Emacs) only by BREAK and STOP from the Signals menu. Once stopped just entering mylist1 again started the infinite recursion again. It&#x27;s like mylist1 is a hidden bomb. Can it be defused? So what exactly is happening with my &quot;don&#x27;t try this at home&quot; experiment?

                    <span>Given that Emurgo received the same 1B ADA as IOHK and CF I would expect them to contribute a lot to support on Deals, adoption etc. Emurgo was initially classified as the commercial arm, however the only big deals seem to come from IOHK and the CF. If they didn&#x27;t sell anything they will receives 50 million ADA/year on steaking rewards and the only prominent thing that they have delivered is YOROI. 
 Now they offer developer courses for money. Even the Plutus pioneers program was free. Did I miss something? Please clarify, but for me this seems like a very good deal for them, bad for us.

it has nothing to do with the Howey test as Digital Aset News speculated here: https://youtu.be/EvCzRpetyOQ
  
Because XRP is also available to trade on Etoro for US clients.
 And ADA and TRX are not even on the list here https://www.cryptoratingcouncil.com/asset-ratings that could be securities where XRP has a 4.o rating.
 ALGO has a 2.0 rating and is much more centralized as ADA. 
 Charles has confirmed here: https://youtu.be/WYQTkf8ndpY that &quot;we&#x27;ve never received any regulatory summons or subpoena or any of these things everything&#x27;s fine cardano&#x27;s fine&quot;
 so it is reasonable to believe that the same is valid for Tron.

                    <span>Hey crypto people :)
 I&#x27;ve been hearing a lot about how Haskell is &quot;hard&quot; and devs won&#x27;t develop on it because of this.
 I would like to give my thoughts on this:
 First, the truth. Haskell is hard. In more broader terms, functional/Declarative languages are hard/less intuitive then the imperative ones (Java/Python/etc...) and we can&#x27;t ignore this fact.
 BUT the thing is...
 It probably won&#x27;t matter in the long run. Why? Because this project is huge. The funding is huge and also the trust and the community. And thus, people will go where the money is. Do you really think people will care when there are multiple dexes/loans protocols/PTE games/etc... that they are written in Haskell? No they won&#x27;t. They want to make money. Period.
 For example, Bitcoin is also very very tough the develop on (due to the utxo model and the weird scripting language it has). This didn&#x27;t (and doesn&#x27;t) stop countless developers to develop on it (myself included). Do you know why (I guess you do by now :) ) ? Because the community, trust and money are there and I think that this will probably be the case for Cardano as well.
 Also, I might be wrong :) Just my 2 cents.
 Cheers

                    <span>Decentralization at team level vs. protocol
 Distributed networks and decentralization are concepts much older than Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto proved that it was possible to create decentralized value that people could own, share and transfer without a middleman. In doing so, he laid the foundation for the entire cryptocurrency industry, or if you prefer, blockchain networks. Every public blockchain network needs native coins to enable decentralization itself. Coins may play a different role in each project, but they have one thing in common. It is necessary to ensure their fair distribution.
 Imagine you want to start a new decentralized project. What do you need? First of all, someone has to define the goals or mission of the project and its basic parameters. Then, some research and analy…</span>

                    <span>Hello fellow peoples,
 ​
 We all know cardano is going to test a 12.5% bigger block size next month to handle all the activity we are having on this great network.
 And it got me thinking, does a bigger block size affect decentralization under the supreme Ouroboros protocol? the future possible nobel prize winner maker protocol that is maintaining the cardano heart beating seamlessly in a secure and decentralized way?
 I have been looking through docs and failed to find anything.
 A great person in a discord told me that technically it makes it slightly less decentralized, but not much. The block size would have to be about 8MB and no changes in how cardano deals with transaction for it to be a worry.
 ​
 What´s your opinion on this?

                    <span>I’m starting to think that ADA people are anti cultural. We are because we have no desire to be instantly gratified and coddled at every turn. 
 I see that most of us view the world as chess players. We seem to look at the projects and tech in terms of decades while every one else views their coin in cycles or just month to month. 
 It’s kind of frustrating interacting with people who see life in right now / all or nothing terms. I can’t even talk half the time to these types without feeling like I’m sacrificing my true opinions.
 Nope. I don’t see the rest the crypto comunity liking us very much because we are not the type of people to just pretend, and put all of our money on ‘red’ or ‘black’. 
 I do think that there are a lot of non Cardano holders of great projects. But damn it seems like Main Stream crypto folks are no different than the guys I play craps with at the casino. This is why I think we get hated on so much. We’re just not like them. 
 I hope I don’t seem too arrogant but that’s my point. I guess when you look at life a few moves ahead of the other guy then you do come off as arrogant. So be it... I’m no better than them their no better than me but let’s just face it, we’re not like the rest.

                    <span>Cardano is about to be listed on one of Europe&#x27;s largest exchanges, Bitstamp. Supposed to happen either tomorrow or Thursday. Great news!
 https://investorplace.com/2021/11/dear-cardano-crypto-fans-mark-your-calendars-for-a-catalyst-on-nov-24/
 PS - Please don&#x27;t confuse this with the Bitpay exchange, though. That&#x27;s another exchange that we&#x27;ve all been recently voting for to list ADA. That voting will continue for another 39 days so vote every day.
 ADOPTION!

                    <span>Hey Haskell Devs,
 I am a Blockchain Master student - not a Dev though - who went through an incubation program for a DApp idea that is especially targeting the Global South/Africa and hence aligns very well with the vision of Cardano. Now I am looking for Haskell capable Devs who wanna team up and then also try to get some funding from the catalyst program and ultimately create a DAO that serves the needs of people in the Global South with a viable use case.

                    <span>I&#x27;m new to Haskell and need to list all possible ways to pair up (even) lists of Ints.
 E.g.
 [1,2,3,4] -&gt; [[(1,2),(3,4)], [(2,3),(1,4)], [(1,3),(2,4)], ...] 
 Generating all possible pairs is easy enough (shown below) but I can&#x27;t work out how to return only ways to pair up the entire input list.
 pairs :: [a] -&gt; [[(a, a)]] pairs l &#x3D; [(x,y) | (x:ys) &lt;- tails l, y &lt;- ys] 
 Any help appreciated!

                    <span>I&#x27;ve had a little fling going on for the past month. It started out as a hookup, then turned into hooking up a couple times a week, then hooking up every other day for the past two weeks. Heading in the direction of something more and I really like her.
 She&#x27;s going home for Thanksgiving, and we hung out before she left. We were in the kitchen eating a snack as I was getting ready to leave, when one of her friends came in to say goodbye. She knows the two of us are hooking up but I&#x27;d never met any of her friends before. We all made small talk for a few minutes but I really did have to go. I was debating whether I should kiss her goodbye in front of her friend but I didn&#x27;t want to come on too strong, but also didn&#x27;t want to not do it since I always kiss her goodbye. Said fuck it and just went for it, just a peck on the lips, nothing crazy. She walked me out and gave me another kiss where her friend couldn&#x27;t see. The door closed, and I paused to pull out my headphones, when I heard the two of them squealing like little schoolgirls (it&#x27;s not that weird, we&#x27;re only seniors in college).
 Hopefully it was the good kind of squeals lol
 Life is good and I feel like im like 15 again :)

                    <span>Not to be an asshat but I think it was said somewhere by the team, if im wrong please correct me if I’m not feel free to provide the source.
 I wouldn’t have a problem waiting for a good product, but it’s a different thing feeling miss led. Ik things take time but if u talk about how dapps are gonna be released 1-2 months after smart contracts im assuming u know something…. Like this isn’t some abstract distant time horizon…
 Anyways i would honestly just love an update from the team and i think many other people would as well.
 Thanks

                    <span>From what little bit I have read on different blockchain scaling solutions, Cardano’s Hydra solution is the best out of all the “Ethereum Killers” because it addresses all known issues with blockchain scaling. Right now, Cardano has a much lower transaction throughput than Solana for example, but I don’t like the way Solana achieves their high throughput because I think that their method of electing leader(s) to generate a proof of history and then broadcast the PoH to the rest of the nodes in the respective cluster leaves them vulnerable to DDOS attacks like the one that caused them to need to restart their network after a period of being shut down. I really love how Algorand has been able to achieve near instant finality for layer one transactions (: wicked fast sending from Coinbase to …</span>

                    <span>I have been playing for some months now with smart contracts templates in solidity and pyteal (algorand python library). That was mainly because I did not know haskell and I wanted to get some expirience developing very simple smart contracts. However, thsese lasts weeks I have been learning haskell and I would like to know how to deploy the different smart contracts that I create. If someone know how to, or could shed some light to the issue I would be very greatful,

                    <span>I&#x27;m heavily invested in Cardano. I&#x27;m looking for an honest, coolheaded discussion about the Voltaire era.
 My understanding is that the more ADA you have, the larger your voting power. That is to say, the more money you have, the more power you can exert over the future of Cardano. So a few rich people will have a strong effect on what propositions reach the ballot (for lack of a better term) AND on the outcome of the vote. Does anyone find this concerning? Am I oversimplifying?
 Assume there exists a proposition that has short-term/long-term tradeoffs. Is there any mechanism to prevent institutions and whales from ramming through a shortsighted vote, cashing out, and leaving Cardano in a worse state in the long run?
 It&#x27;s the classic &quot;two wolves and a lamb voting on what to eat for lunch&quot; scenario. Will there be any checks against this behavior?

                    <span>Hi,
 I would like to know some more datails about how is pool over saturation working:
 Do all delegators get lesser rewards or only the &quot;late&quot; comers? 
 If it&#x27;s only the &quot;late&quot; comers is decided by the time they made &quot;delegation&quot; transaction?
 How do I know it&#x27;s me who gets lesser rewards?
 Is saturation percentage updated during epoch or only on epoch boundary?

 ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️
 Please read the Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users.
 There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano&#x27;s social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.
 For example, searching &#x27;cardano&#x27; on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):
 ​
 Ongoing &#x27;giveaway&#x27; scams on Youtube
 The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be &#x27;live&#x27;; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.
 Do not be fooled!
 ​
 To be clear:
  
⚠️ There is no such thing as a Cardano giveaway
 ⚠️ Never share your seed phrase with ANYONE
 ⚠️ Never send ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
 ⚠️ You will never be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff
  
Please report scams on the Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau.
 ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️

                    <span>Hello, all.
 The fake Daedalus app has just been published to the Play Store again (for the fifth time in around four months if I remember correctly). 
 Please help out the Cardano community by doing either (or both) of the following:
  
If you have an Android phone, install the app to downvote it with a scam warning before deleting it again. Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id&#x3D;com.opencardano.protocol
 
Upvote the scam warnings and downvote the fake reviews.
 
Report the app to Google.. 
 
 If a lot of people help out, Google should remove it within one to three days. I still don&#x27;t understand how Google allows this to be republished each time. I will keep on monitoring the Play Store and notify this subreddit when it appears.
 Thank you for your time!

                    <span>Is anyone else struggling to discover a pool to stake in that is extremely consistent? I’m personally struggling to find a pool that will hold a consistent 5% average and I’m wondering you guys are having trouble with this too?
 Edit: I understand that rewards fluctuate, my issue is with pools lifetime ROI dropping

What would be the ideal time to switch stake pools, the epoch that the Sundae ISPO begins or before it begins. Don&#x27;t want to change stake pools to early and miss out on XRAY, but also dont want to get in to late and miss out on Sundae?

                    <span>I remember a couple of blog posts that went viral on hackernews. As I roughly recall both were in the form of &quot;interviews&quot; with an interviewer asking basic questions and the interviewee taking them into a deviant descent into madness.
 One warped Haskell, the theoretically sound and purely functional language, into essentially assembly code. The other (and I&#x27;m more fuzzy on this) programmed using only c headers, or something equally absurd that is not intended to write real programs.

                    <span>See: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences.
 With chrisdone we just added DList &amp; Acc &amp; snoc benchmarks into comparison.
 I think it is useful for everyone to see &quot;if old folk DList recommendation to solve [] problems actually holds water&quot;.
 Because there is a direct comparison with numbers now.
 To be sure I additionally checked with spl (DList author) in: https://github.com/spl/dlist/issues/102 &amp; chrisdone of course holds the benchmarking repository.
  
Where is no benchmarks for data types - it implies the library/data type authors consider operation counterproductive to structure &amp; so those operations made not idiomatic (like for simple snocing the [] one needs to list  [el] - [] does not provide snocing operation for reason of it being counterproductive) - it means the operation to be composite/requires conversion into other data type &amp; so not showable in the benchmark
  
Would note that DList is not designed for strictness.
 DList data design relies on the leverage of Haskell laziness &amp; function composition, please use DList as it is by default.
  
An update:
 Acc claim still checks-out under conditions for purpose of the data type. For example - DList is created to be consumed partially &amp; in a lazy fashion, while Acc is created to be a builder type that goes into full normalization to be converted into a storage type (like Vector or Seq). So every type has its own domain of application &amp; haskell-perf/sequences currently has not enough benchmarks to show all particularities of types under different conditions of use.
 As I opened: 1. Please, make a traverse test: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/24 2. Please, add to/fromList conversion tests: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/26 3. Please, add a NFData normalization benchmark: https://github.com/haskell-perf/sequences/issues/27

                    <span>Hi!
 I am trying to use {-# LANGUAGE LinearTypes #-} to make one of my user-facing APIs safer. However, I find myself in a situation where I am relying on a third-party function that has no linear type. Is there some escape hatch that lets me take my argument in a a %1 -&gt; b and give it to a function a -&gt; b?
 I tried to google this and found some references that said there were no such hatch, but they were quite old so perhaps things changed since then. If I can not do this I am afraid I won&#x27;t be able to use LT for a while. I just want to use LT to make my API safer, not my implementation.
 Thanks

 What are some good resources for learning haskell if I have experience with java?

                    <span>There&#x27;s nothing more spiritually (and physically) ugly than losers who try to use family events to pontificate about their retarded politics and to try to embarrass or upset their family members! If you do this, you deserve to be disowned and not invited to any more family events!

                    <span>I use this mental model called &#x27;Play to your strengths&#x27;. It&#x27;s more a saying than a model, but a model nonetheless. Anyways it has helped me build great things, since I can only ever build on strength. I fix my weaknesses where I can, but I don&#x27;t pay my weaknesses too much attention.
There&#x27;s this whole cult about &#x27;fixing&#x27; yourself, and seminars galore by &#x27;successful people&#x27; who want you to mimic their behaviors so you can be &#x27;successful&#x27; too, so I avoid this groupthink.
What other little sayings do you repeat to yourself or what other mental models do you employ daily?

                    <span>Hello,
 I am working on some data visualization and I was wondering, how much are staking rewards expected to decline per year ?
 Is it 5% ? Thank you, I looked but couldn&#x27;t find an estimate.
 So right now its APY 4.5-5% but next year, we can expect a little decline to around 4.275-4.75% ?
 I also read that &quot;fees&quot; will come in and help pay rewards in the future, will this mitigate the natural decay of reserve ?

                    <span>I&#x27;m a software developer, and I used to work in TradFi before I got sick of how bad it was/is for the world, and left to find a new job. I&#x27;m in the application phase now, but it&#x27;s my absolute dream to get hired by IOHK; I also have a compilers background, so I have plenty of experience with languages like Haskell and Rust.
 Anyone know about any Cardano companies that are hiring for this kinda work?

                    <span>Hey all!
 I have a shop in Athens, Greece. I am considering to accept Cardano as a method of payment for my products.
 Does anyone know how I can make such thing possible?

                    <span>I’m very passionate about the project, and badly want to contribute to this ecosystem. I have time, but am somewhat short on expertise and applicable skills, so while I want to contribute somehow, I don’t see any route to doing so besides applying for a new CS/STEM degree, and focusing on that for half a decade. I’d prefer to start getting my paws dirty now, and use that time in a more directed way. That’s not to say I’m not looking for advice about relevant education to acquire, but rather that I’d prefer to choose some kind of activity which doesn’t have a mountain of prerequisite knowledge blocking it. What does Cardano’s decentralized brain need right now?
 Thanks in advance for any thoughts on this.

                    <span>A kind reminder to vote for Cardano EVERY DAY. We are doing great already but we are behind TRON 32% vs 37% only 5% behind !
 BitPlay listing of ADA will boost the price and provide more visibility.

                    <span>Is there a way to know whether a stake pool is owned by big entities like binance? I want to avoid staking into these kind of pools. Even better if there is such a website that lists small stake pools or marks them so that it is easier for us to stake on them.

                    <span>Hello! 
 I am currently trying to use Hashlips Program on Github to create my own CNFT Collection, It works amazing but sadly the only issue is that it does not create suitable Metadata for CNFT&#x27;s/MakerPro. 
 Does anyone know of or have anything similar that would work to fulfil this problem for me &lt;3 Sadly I am extremely new to any sort of code and watched too many videos to count by now and i&#x27;m struggling bad to solve this problem.

                    <span>Hi all,I would like to bring some visibility to the Project Catalyst proposal which aims to get funding to implement alternative node implementation for Cardano, alongside the Haskell reference implementation for Fund7.

                    <span>Consider the following function which pulls out the elements of m with keys of the form [i,j] for some characters i and j. Can you spot the mistake?
 import Data.Map as M subTable :: Char -&gt; M.Map String Int -&gt; M.Map Char Int subTable i m &#x3D; M.foldrWithKey maybeInsert M.empty m where maybeInsert :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; Row -&gt; Row maybeInsert [i,j] v r &#x3D; insert j v r maybeInsert _ _ r &#x3D; r 
 Indeed, the mistake is that in maybeInsert I am trying to pattern match on a previously bound variable i. But the compiler no longer recognises i as bound, and it compiles fine... but the code doesn&#x27;t behave as intended. Should the compiler allow this in a where block? I would suggest it should at least include a warning. I imagine many of us have made this mistake at some point...
 For reference, my intended behaviour is achieved by 
 maybeInsert [i1,j] v r | i1&#x3D;&#x3D;i &#x3D; insert j v r | otherwise &#x3D; r

                    <span>For example
 import GHC.Stack x :: HasCallStack &#x3D;&gt; Int x &#x3D; (srcLocStartLine . snd . last . getCallStack) callStack main &#x3D; do print x print x print x 
 results in
 7 8 9 
 and after rewriting with a rewrite rule we take for granted:
 import GHC.Stack x :: HasCallStack &#x3D;&gt; Int x &#x3D; (srcLocStartLine . snd . last . getCallStack) callStack main &#x3D; do let y &#x3D; x print y print y print y 
 outputs
 7 7 7 
 That is to say, referential transparency is violated. There&#x27;s an easy fix: change the type of callStack from
 callStack :: HasCallStack &#x3D;&gt; CallStack 
 to
 callStack :: HasCallStack &#x3D;&gt; IO CallStack 
 Observing call stacks in IO is perfectly reasonable. (So technically it&#x27;s not HasCallStack that breaks referential transparency, but callStack.)
 But I can&#x27;t be the first person to make this objection. It must have been made before the proposal to add HasCallStack was accepted. What was the explanation for dismissing it? I can&#x27;t find the proposal in the ghc-proposals repo. Perhaps the functionality predates that repo.

                    <span>I have been playing with some text processing in Haskell, and I would like to import a text file &#x60;&quot;AliceInWonderland.txt&quot;&#x60; and see how my functions perform. However, when I try to read the file &#x60;alice &#x3D; readFile &quot;AliceInWonderland.txt&quot;&#x60; I naturally encounter the obstacle that &#x60;alice&#x60; is not a &#x60;String&#x60; but rather an &#x60;IO String&#x60; on which I cannot readily apply my &#x60;functions :: String -&gt; Whatever&#x60;, nor can I &#x60;show&#x60; their result if I lift their return value to IO (&#x60;liftedFun x &#x3D; return $ functions x&#x60; can then be composed as &#x60;alice &gt;&gt;&#x3D; liftedFun&#x60;). Aside: Is there a better way to lift a function than &#x60;liftedFun x &#x3D; return $ functions x&#x60;?
 Is there a good way around this? I would like to just import the text and keep playing and testing my code, preferably without having to play laborious for every step.

                    <span>This is throwing me off:
 ghci &gt; scanl ( flip (:)) [] [3 ,2 ,1] [[] ,[3] ,[2 ,3] ,[1 ,2 ,3]] 
 scanl is like foldl, so isn&#x27;t the first call to the lambda have 2 parameters [] and 3?
 The accumulator and x like:
 (/acc x -&gt; x : acc) --so why is it giving [] as the first element of result? 
 The [] is an intermediate accumulator in the case of scanl? So it&#x27;s like foldl but slightly different?
 This definition on Hoogle for foldl:
 foldl :: Foldable t &#x3D;&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; b
 vs what I imagined it to be but is wrong:
 fold::(b-&gt;a-&gt;b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b 
 t a means &quot;the current value of some List of type a&quot;?

                    <span>I too need to do more. We all need to be spreading Cardano on the crypto subreddits and twitter. We need to not let people shush us up with bogus and false information and push back on that info, do what we can to prove them wrong. I am going to be trying to post more articles and video links about all the good things about Cardano. Cardanos value won&#x27;t naturally get to really high prices without the help of the community. I hope everyone agrees and if we all even just make one post every once in a while each we can really help Cardano get to where it belongs.

                    <span>So I&#x27;ve come to know that future transactions on the Cardano blockchain will be paid in DJED which is when minted, gives COTI a cut. 
 What happened to transactions giving ADA a use case? With governance / validation being the main use cases does that not make it very close to security-like chsracteristics? 
 Secondly, I thought in the long term as all ADA gets released into circulation, stakers would be paid out in transaction fees as network activity ramps up. Does thst mean somewhere down the line staking generates DJED instead of ADA? 
 Genuinely curious, this dynamic is sort of confusing.

                    <span>I know in the past some exchanges had a bit of difficulty implementing certain coins wallets, if I remember correctly nano was one of them and cardano was another, alot of crypto casinos offer many different types of deposits, I have been invested in cardano since 2016, although I don&#x27;t know as much about it as I really should. My question is, is it possible to implement cardano as an option on a crypto casino?

                    <span>Hello guys,
 So the PAB update is just around the corner. According to coinmarketcal is should happen by the end of this month.
 Will this update alone allow for dApps to be released on the network? I heard people talking about several phases of PAB update, so I&#x27;m not sure if this next update alone would already allow for apps to be launched and would like some clarification on that.
 Tried searching but didn&#x27;t find any thread with this info.
 Thanks!

                    <span>A fees system on public blockchain networks is a big topic. Different projects have their own strategies. We will provide a basic overview. Then, we explain different points of view in this article with respect to the present and future of fees on Cardano. 
 Why fees are important
 There is always a price to pay for good service. If you don’t pay anything, the other party probably has some other benefits arising from the service. Perhaps these benefits are not obvious at first glance and the counterparty tries to keep them secret. Bank accounts and transactions used to be paid for. Today, bank customers in many countries do not pay the fees, or the price has gone down significantly. Public blockchain networks offer people an alternative financial system. To make this alternative user-frien…</span>

 So Cardano will get an algorithmic stablecoin. What is COTI getting out of it?
 COTI was the recipient of Cardano cfund, is that all they got?

 Anyone else havint this issue? 
 Surprises me alot of people are having this problem but so few talk about it. 
 We should be more vocal when this happens. If you want to move your assets and cannot do it, it creates insecurity. And Cardano not about this feeling.

                    <span>Hello guys. im new to cardano and i started researching more and more. Im a elixir and go developer and i have some project in mind. lets get to point. I want my project to be as a platform that has currency in it. in form of cardano token. I played around with cli and it seems so much straigh forward than eth. i have few questions.
 • How do i calculate worth of my token • Is it even possible to use token as a currency? • Once i create a token, is there a way to add more tokens to a pool?
 Please keep in mind, im still new to this stuff. i know the basics. please explain to me like im a child :)

                    <span>Hello Haskellers of Reddit,
 This may be an inappropriate question for this subreddit, if so let me know and I will take it down right away, but this is a community who&#x27;s opinions on this matter I respect.
 I love math and computer science and their intersection, and I have a career choice conundrum. Here is what I want: my dream is to work towards a garageband hedgefund. I love the math and programming challenges in finance, I love the control you get over the direction you take, I love the immediate and direct feedback on your work, I love the excitement and the power and the challenge, I love the data accumulation and processing infrastructure you can create, I love the high and low level thinking involved. I want to be able to whole heartedly work towards a career in this field.
 Here is another set of desires: I also want to contribute to society. I want to work towards making peoples lives better. I want to deepen as a person and work towards being a human of heart.
 These two ideas seem to be in direct conflict and have left me floundering directionless during my Masters degree in software and math. I would really appreciate thoughts from this community which seems to straddle a line between math, programming, and passion.

                    <span>I was reading Learn You a Haskell for Great Good. There was this line
  
Notice how we pattern matched on (x :-: xs) . That works because pattern matching is actually about matching constructors. We can match on :-: because it is a constructor for our own list type and we can also match on : because it is a constructor for the built-in list type. Same goes for []. Because pattern matching works (only) on constructors, we can match for stuff like that, normal prefix constructors or stuff like 8 or &#x27;a&#x27;, which are basically constructors for the numeric and character types, respectively.
  
Here the code comes from hs infixr 5 :-: data List a &#x3D; Empty | a :-: (List a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord) 
 Can you please elaborate this section please.

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 Can someone please enlighten me about slot leader and input endorsers?
 From searching docs, I find the following:
 &quot;Slot leaders operate in epochs to listen for and confirm transactions to produce blocks, which are then approved by input endorsers. A Cardano input endorser is the second set of stakeholders that verifies transactions included in blocks. It’s believed this design is scalable since the network can increase the number of slots per epoch and run multiple epochs across the network simultaneously.&quot;
 Does that mean that: 1) Sufficiently saturated (but not oversaturated) stake pools get a high chance of randomly selected as slot leaders for a certain epoch.
 2) Non-selected stake pools get given a role of &quot;input endorser&quot; for this epoch. Or does this mean delegators using a &quot;heavy client&quot; such as Daedalus? 
 Additional questions: *What does it mean to increase the number of slots per epoch? Add more stake pools, while reducing the saturation point per pool? *How exactly does this increase transaction speed or capacity? 
 Thank you in advance.

                    <span>I was wondering if people could break down what all you can do with your ADA. Most people on here already know about staking, others trade it or hold it in hopes of profit. 
 I’m wondering what are some other ways I can utilize my ADA that maybe aren’t so mainstream in the Cardano community. 
 I’ve heard of lending, but am not sure how to go about it. I’ve also heard of the Drunken Dragon game, but don’t know too much about it. 
 Can anyone give me some suggestions on how to fully utilize my ADA?

                    <span>For me it was due to the TED talk by Charles six years ago. Bringing identification services and banking services to those that need it most is nothing but exceptional. Even if the project failed (which it wont) it is still worthy to contribute, makes me sleep well at night. This really can change lives for the better. Im HODLing hard.

                    <span>[Edit: Solved] Guys - can somebody help me out with a more direct contact to VeriTree than the generic form on their web page? I&#x27;m happy to be relayed via involved people of Cardano Foundation etc. if you don&#x27;t know a direct contact or discord or something (DM me).
 Background: A couple of weeks ago, I&#x27;ve contacted compensaid (https://compensaid.com/) who are managing the carbon offsets for Lufthansa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lufthansa), the second largest European Airline, and suggested that VeriTree would bring some much-needed accountability into their carbon offset projects. After receiving a rather generic answer at first, they followed up personally, asking for a qualified contact at VeriTree. Alas, while I do have some of their tokens in my wallet, I don&#x27;t have a direct contact.
 [Edit]: All good! Contact was found, people were introduced, things are moving forward. Thanks to everyone who pitched in!

The whole thing is interesting, but this is what modern business executives and future CEOs ( could be you) will be implementing as part of your business structure. From the london business school live presentation Ask an Entrepreneur series, just a segment about tracking education and verifying qualifications.
 This just shows how far forward Cardano is thinking, setting standards before standards are there.

                    <span>Old New Guy here, looking over the Cryptocurrency space, and Cardano in particular. From what little I&#x27;ve learned to date, I&#x27;m impressed with the Spirit of this effort, the Logic of slow but steady Peer reviewed progress to further the effort. So much to wrap ones mind around.
 A practical question I have, is there anyone utilizing the Cardano Platform for an Apllication/program for the creation of stablecoins backed by commodities, and Precious Metals in particular?

                    <span>So the information is really murky to me on what the PAB means as far as the ADA ecosystem firing up. I thought PAB deadline was mid November, Is that what it means? Are DEXes around the corner? Will I actually be able to use the token to create or are we waiting a long time while the price plummets too low for me to have dry powder do anything? I bought the majority of my cardano in anticipation to use for the ecosystem and get in on the ground floor, I really don&#x27;t care about the price unless it cuts my sandbox funds in half. How are we supposed to participate as a community if we&#x27;re firewalled everywhere?

                    <span>Ive had the Daedalus wallet on my pc laptop for a few years now. The wallet is up to date yet it keeps disconnecting from the server as I get to 99.9%. Sometimes I can see the wallets and amounts but the blockchain syncs and then stops node. its so frustrating. 
 ​
 I then downloaded onto my MacBook Air but 8 hrs later, its at 99.9% and Im not out of space. This wallet sucks so much. I understand that its downloading the entire blockchain but after a week of trying to download on 2 different computers, Im not having much luck. Is there another way to get my ADA off there?

                    <span>I am tracking some NFT&#x27;s and token&#x27;s that went missing from my wallet through various blockchain explorers. The entire NFTs and FTs in the wallet went missing while testing out ccwallets swap feature. 
 Two questions: 
  
All the tokens are going from an DdzFF type address to another every few hours. Is there anywhere like pool.pm that supports viewing of this type of (Byron era/Daedalus) wallet? 
 Can anyone explain why all of my former tokens are the sole tokens in the wallet and why they are moving from one wallet to another? I would assume if it&#x27;s on an exchange, there would be far more than just the tokens I had in the wallet.
 
 Diving deep into blockchain. Any educational blockchain exploration resources and answers to the questions are much appreciated.

Is there a tool that people use for this, or do I need to just write a script to iterate over packages in my local Hackage index, download the package, and grep the source code myself?

                    <span>Hi, we were trying to figure out an ideal way to represent Semver. There are a few ways we&#x27;ve tried representing semver however each has its drawbacks. Here are the 3 possible implementations we&#x27;ve considered each of them have drawbacks:
  
Simple data type data Version Natural Natural Natural
 
Sum type data Version &#x3D; Major0Minor1Patch0 | Major0Minor2Patch0 | Major1Minor0Patch0 | Major1Minor1Patch0
 
Use a sum type on each major minor patch version. This is the approach we are currently taking: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell data Patch &#x3D; Patch0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)
 
 data Minor &#x3D; Minor0 | Minor1 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)
 data Major &#x3D; Major0 deriving (Eq, Show, Generic, Enum, Bounded)
 data Version &#x3D; Version { major :: Major , minor :: Minor , patch :: Patch } deriving (Generic, Eq, Show) &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Requirements:
 Serialization/deserialization via aeson
 Complicated pattern matching
 This is important with event sourcing as some consumers may not care about minor version changes only major version changes.
 If we have a new major version and we don&#x27;t handle it then we want to fail to compile.
 1: Wouldn&#x27;t give us strong compile-time guarantees. I don&#x27;t know all actual versions we have.
 2: Forces us to handle all versions even if the consumer does not care. I don&#x27;t have a way to say I only care about Major versions.
 3: Lets us handle only major version changes, and we know all possible major versions. However, we are representing a product and can introduce versions that don&#x27;t really exist. e.g. if we have 0.1.0, 1.0.0, 1.1.0 then if we create a 1.2.0 we are now also representing 0.2.0.
 I&#x27;m curious if anyone has an alternative representation that might be better. Thanks!

 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/candidate/changelog
 Please give it a try.
 What&#x27;s next?
 In the next couple of months I&#x27;ll be working with maintainers of downstream packages to identify migration opportunities. The plan is to patch entire head.hackage (which includes, for instance, pandoc) before cutting a final release of text-2.0.
 Thanks to Ben Gamari&#x27;s efforts, text submodule in GHC source tree has been already bumped to 2.0-rc1. The next major release of GHC (9.4, ~Q3 2022) will ship with text-2.0.

                    <span>Does anyone use Sublime as their primary environment for Haskell learning as a beginner ?
 What packages you use, which linter, etc. What other helpful things do you use ? 
 P.S: I googled around for some tutorials but most seem outdated, I know I can use some more specific IDE&#x27;s but I would like to continue using Sublime.

                    <span>So as I understand, something like this
 data List a &#x3D; Nil | Cons a (List a) 
 is considered a sum type because it is a sort of set theory &quot;sum&quot; or &quot;disjoint union&quot; of the two constructors. A disjoint union, as I understand, is just when you have a union of sets that have nothing shared; you &quot;summed&quot; the sets. So we imagine our List above a sort of disjoint union of Nil and Cons a (List a). Correct? What gets confusing is from a Wikipedia article on Algebraic data types :
  
In set theory the equivalent of a sum type is a disjoint union, a set whose elements are pairs consisting of a tag (equivalent to a constructor) and an object of a type corresponding to the tag (equivalent to the constructor arguments).
  
The disjoint union article was fairly understandable, but I&#x27;m not making the connection between my List above and this quote above about tags and constructors and constructor arguments. Nice if someone could shine some light on this for me.

                    <span>So I have a wallet on mainnet that has been funded with a few ADA @ https://explorer.cardano.org/en/transaction?id&#x3D;617ba47b8e8d35a7512eb81c73b470b1aba78ed029838409313d4a127d895dd3
 You can see from the link that the funds exist, thus they must have been written to the chain.
 But when I query that address in cardano-cli, it is returning nothing as if the wallet is empty:
 &quot;--------------------------------------------------------------------------&quot;
 I&#x27;m unable to mint a native token without the TxHash/TxIx from that output - any idea what I&#x27;m doing wrong?

                    <span>I am someone who has had a few hundred locked in a well known layer 1 defi platform for nearly a year. I imagine I can&#x27;t be the only one. Is it possible that sometime in the future I will be able to access those markets again through cardano?
 I would prefer to stick to ETH but to be completely honest - I&#x27;ve lost all faith and see it as being a road to no where. Not trying to rag too much on other cryptos but in all fairness not everyone will have 32 eth in life. I dont know where the get the idea that anyone can be a validator if you need 32 eth.

                    <span>Just curious about where I can go to interact with DeFi, smart contracts and dapps with Cardano. I&#x27;ll be honest I haven&#x27;t given this network a fair shake and I want to give it due diligence. I want to see what Cardano has to offer first hand.

                    <span>Hi Cardano community! And especially: Plutus Pioneer Program participants.
 I am wondering what you are up to now. Are you developing Dapps in Haskell to be launched on Cardano? Or, did you simply take the course and move back daily life?
 Also: was the course up to the quality you had hoped, and did it indeed provide you with the right toolkit to start your Cardano journey? 
 Finally, and broadly to anyone: do you know whether the program is still running on full steam, with full classes? 
 Love to hear any insights on this! 
 Cheers

                    <span>Hey guys! I&#x27;m sure everyone in here is aware of the strong friendship and deep collaboration between Cardano and SingularityNET. While we are still waiting for the ERC20-converter to finally go live, SingularityNETs first spinoff project SingularityDAO just had its debut as launchpad yesterday. Being the DeFi-arm of the SingularityNET-ecosystem, SingularityDAO will launch every upcoming Snet spinoff project. The first project that launched yesterday is Nunet, a decentralized compute project. One of the goals of Nunet is to provide the computing ressources for the whole ecosystem - running endless AI agents and eventually the creation of an AGI (artificial general intelligence) will take a lot of ressources. And what&#x27;s better than an in-house decentralized compute project? There are already…</span>

                    <span>When will the Alonzo-testnet have the capability
 to submit transactions from inside the Plutus
 script (e.g. submitTxConstraints, submitTxConstraintsSpending)
 as opposed to only cardano-cli commands?
 ​
 Will the PAB implementation correct this?
 ​
 It seems like the Alonzo-testnet only has the capability to
 handle on-chain code (like validator scripts). If I&#x27;m
 wrong, could you please send me an example of a contract,
 running on the Alonzo-testnet, that can &quot;submitTxConstraints&quot;.

 Just a post to stir up some ungodly speculation and fun for the community, no one is really looking at us right now, and there are opportunities RIPE for the taking, we have sundae swap ISPO happening now, and lots of other interesting projects such as Ergo Dex on the horizon. I&#x27;m by no means a professional in this space, I&#x27;m here to speculate and find some cool projects I can get behind, and thought it might be nice to create a Reddit post as a resource for the community to talk about your favorite ecosystem plays per category? 
 I&#x27;m going to go through cardanocube.io and attempt to pick 1 project per category and then spend the next few days learning why my picks were good or bad and hopefully update this based on your views? Not only will this help me learn but I&#x27;m hoping ever…</span>

                    <span>I have ADA staked. I like what I have seen in terms of the deliberate development of Cardano. However I&#x27;d be very interested to hear what shortcomings you feel it has right now compared to other cryptos? In another sub someone said that Cardano has missed the boat on defi. It made me wonder if this community agrees and what else may be areas where Cardano needs to improve. Maybe this is the wrong place to discuss possible downsides, but I&#x27;m hoping some of you have serious opinions you can share.

 But when I query the address using cardano cli on my local Linux node it returns ---------- as if there is no balance.
 The transaction settled almost an hour ago, any idea what I&#x27;m doing wrong?

 I have:
 1- One input which has the balance in lovelace.

                    <span>There already exists a few smart contract based NFT marketplaces. They are good, but they use NFTs as inputs to help with concurrency and others just ignore it and hope that a eUTXO isn&#x27;t consumed at the same time.
 Is it possible to implement an MFT market place where a user does not require input eUTXOs thus the bidding process in basically, except for transaction size, infinitely scalable. So a user creates an auction. Then other users bid on it. They execute a smart contract that is only successful if their bid is higher than the minimum for the auction. The bidding process continues and users can bid, whether or not their bid is higher. Users can also cancel their bid.
 Then when the deadline is met. The owner of the auction or the user with the maximum bid can close the sale. How do …</span>

                    <span>Time for another hls release!:
  
@pepeiborra has done an epic work to improve performance, redefining some of the core pieces of HLS 
 You can take an overall look to improvements in these slides
 Performance would be noticeable in large projects without too much template haskell usage
 
 We have fourmolu support for ghc-9.0.1 thanks to @georgefst
 We have got improvements over import suggestions thanks to @yoshitsugu and @alexnaspo
 Completions also has been improved in general thanks again to @pepeiborra

                    <span>There&#x27;s lots of change (daily it seems) as things are updated for the new arch. It seems that some people have managed to get things built during this transition. Most of the options I have tried, however, have failed to produce any builds at all. I&#x27;ve been on nix. I&#x27;ve tried stack. Nothing works.
 I am certain some people have gotten it all to work, but the canonical sources for installing have not allowed me to build even a basic Hello World project and such knowledge for how to do so seems scattered in mindspace now as far as I can tell. 
 My goal is to just code with Haskell. I&#x27;m willing to do any hacks to just compile my code and explore. Tips?

                    <span>Hey there,
 I am currently working on a project for College involving Scotty/Blaze libraries for web server needs. When I began working on the project, I could build the application using stack, with no problem at all, and recently, I moved the project for other reason and it won&#x27;t compile anymore, saying the following. On other computers, it works well, so I am wondering where I did wrong...
 I tried to install the correct version Win32 using stack install Win32-2.13.1 yet it did not helped much, and also tried to purge my Haskell installation from my computer, yet it did not solve a bit.
 Please remove if not relevant to the r/, I am so frustrated right now...

                    <span>My family is a fucking nightmare. My 6 year old cousin is the typical neoliberal girl boss type, she’s literally addicted to Disney stuff and YouTube. whenever I’m mildly critical she just says “let people enjoy things”. 
 My 3 year old nephew is so fucking cringe, he’s more of a centrist and I know he’s gonna start some shit. Am I the asshole for thinking I should just cut contact with these narcissists?

                    <span>So i have been into crypto for about a year now, but still i don&#x27;t understand half of the things people are speaking about. Im not super smart but not dumb to so idk if its just me or not :p
 I understand the basics on how crypto works proof of work/proof of stake/blockchain technology but when it comes to dapps and defi etc im just kinda lost. I try to understand it but its difficult.
 do any of you guys know a good guide or book or pdf where everything is explained step by step so i can get deeper into crypto?
 Thanks for the read!

                    <span>This is a blog post from Ergo about what Taproot means for ERGO. Because Ergo and Cardano (along with other members of the UTxO Alliance like CKB) share the eUTxO model, all of this is equally applicable to Cardano.
 The key takeaway:
 &quot;The addition of BIP340 and zero-knowledge proofs for Bitcoin enables interoperability between Ergo [and Cardano] and Bitcoin, allowing for private cross-chain atomic swaps and potentially sidechaining in the future. &quot;
 Cardano + Bitcoin.
 This is bullish.

                    <span>As the title says. I couldn’t find this information easily anywhere.
 My SSD space is limited, so I need to delete it.
 Also, is there a way of changing the default location to an external hard drive?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit:
 Found this article with the blockchain location info both of mac and windows:

                    <span>I&#x27;m not going to lie. When I first got into Cardano I did not understand Blockchain tech or my country&#x27;s monetary system. After months of research. I think I can hold my own in a pretty extensive discussion about Cardano and where I see this ecosystem going. I&#x27;m extremely excited about the tech and partnerships on Cardano but there is one part of all this that I just don&#x27;t understand the hype. Non - fungible tokens particularly. I was never a collector of art, I never collected anything to be honest, but I found myself towards the beginning of my crypto journey obsessing over non- fungible token projects. I would skim the Cardano Kidz website and get excited about each series that was coming out. Then when it was time. I would choke. I just couldn&#x27;t do it. I couldn&#x27;t spend my hard earned money on a picture. I couldn&#x27;t justify it, to myself or my wife. I thought to myself... Why was I so excited in the first place? I don&#x27;t collect things? I&#x27;ve never collected shit in my life. What made me so excited about this art? Well as I thought about it, I&#x27;ve come to a conclusion. The truth is I don&#x27;t understand the hype. I was more excited about the tech behind non- fungible tokens then I was about the actual picture. I see the value in its verifiability and how revolutionary that verifiability is. But I&#x27;m not an art collector. I never was, and I felt kinda stupid for acting like I cared to be one. I&#x27;m happy people are using the Cardano blockchain, but I realized something today. 
 I just don&#x27;t care as much as I thought I did about these current Non fungible tokens.

 The intro I wrote teacher said it was too confusing as she has no idea what crypto is nor has she heard of it and I may have got carried away from the basic

                    <span>Hi, when I was looking for my staking address I found this post saying that there is no point using multiple addresses because your staking address can be determined from a single receiving address and a history of all your transactions derived from that.
 Is this true?
 I love Cardano but it seems to me like a pretty big privacy flaw that needs addressed if it is true

                    <span>I am using Koinly to generate a tax report. Everything has gone effortlessly until I had to add my Cardano wallet information.
 You have three choices for the app to track your transactions: 
 1) upload csv for each wallet (and edit the document appropriately) 2) upload wallet addresses (for UTXO-based wallets this means every external and internal wallet you&#x27;ve ever used (very tedious, and Koinly has difficulty editing UTXO transactions, that&#x27;s why they recommend the following) 3) upload xPUB key and sync transactions
 3 is the easiest and most efficient. But when I use the key for my wallet that is provided on the yoroi chrome extension then the Koinly sync shows 0 transactions (it also shows 0 on cardanoscan). Which is incorrect. This has happened for all my wallets on yoroi.
 Does anyone know why this is happening?

                    <span>I installed Daedalus wallet a few months ago. But now I wanted to verify the SHA256 checksum. It is different then the one on this page: 
 Daedalus - Downloads (daedaluswallet.io) 
 But I receive all updates.
 Version 4.4.1#19369
 I&#x27;m pretty sure I downloaded it from the correct website in the past.

What all other details shall I be aware/careful with or pay attention to ? 4. How do I choose the right stake pool ? (Like the saturation and everything)

This issue is also being tracked here: https://forum.cardano.org/t/massive-scam-pool-group-uncovered/85194
 Starting with this epoch huge amount of undetected fake pools was created - all pools share same relay IPs as MELD4, hosted by cloud service Contabo in Dusseldorf. Most of these relays have weird unrelated domains like &quot;relayeverstake.cloud&quot; or &quot;relaystakepoolservice.site&quot; always privately registered to someone in Hanoi / Vietnam.

                    <span>Hey Everyone!
 Let&#x27;s go...
 Newly covered today: 
  
IOHK has dropped their new article on eUTxO dApp architecture. It explains in detail a design for an eUTxO order book. https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/16/architecting-dapps-on-the-eutxo-ledger/
 Apparently we saw over 1MM transactions in Epoch 302. https://twitter.com/ccvaultio/status/1460673461614006276
 Looks like Cardano is seeing a huge amount of on-chain activity. The crazy part is this is all pre-PAB. Just wait until dApps can actually launch! Unsurprisingly, some supporters of other chains were shocked to realize they didn’t understand the difference between exchange trading volume and actual blockchain use volume. https://twitter.com/cardano_daily/status/1460238659098005504 https://messari.io/screener/most-active-chains-DB0…</span>

                    <span>I work for a tiny company (7 developers) which offers a sophisticated financial model. Our core software was written 20 years ago in C, and our new development is in a proprietary scripting language. This scripting language was never really meant to be used so widely, and it&#x27;s becoming difficult/painful to maintain. I have gotten really into functional programming lately so I started thinking about it as a solution. Specifically, I want to slowly replace all this code in our proprietary language with code in an off-the-shelf, functional language. Enter Haskell: from all my research, it emerged as my favorite choice. Fundamentally, our model just does a bunch of math on many lists of numbers (to give more context: the big competitors to our model are Excel spreadsheets). Haskell seems well …</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;ve watched this chick I know go from SJW, started listening to this podcast then became a radfem TERF, then anti psychiatry, now LARPing as a catholic, anti vaxxer and Kyle Rittenhouse stan, always posting about being &quot;submissive and breedable&quot; etc. whatever happened to her radfem views? Not a fucking clue. I&#x27;m pretty sure this chick has BPD even though she denies mental illnesses exist in women and it is all just a ~normal~ response to trauma.
 It&#x27;s just funny these people hate on normies and liberals for getting all their views from MSM, but they regurgitate anything online grifters tell them and completely reinvent themselves because they have no real sense of who they are offline.
 How do you deal with people like this?

                    <span>During my internship at Tweag, I worked on creating a
safe interface for the sparkle library under the excellent mentorship of Facundo
Domínguez. sparkle is a Haskell library that provides bindings for
Apache Spark using inline-java’s Java interop capabilities.
As such, this new safe interface accomplishes the same
thing that inline-java’s safe interface does; it helps to ensure safe
management of Java references at compile-time using linear types.
As discussed in this earlier post,
we need to be careful to free Java references provided by inline-java when they’re done
being used, and we also shouldn’t use them after they’ve been freed. Since sparkle
manipulates references to Java objects defined in the Spark Java library, any potential users
must take care to safely manage references when…</span>

                    <span>In other chain, I have to add asset to make sure the token will be able to get into my wallet. So far, I&#x27;ve only used Daedalus to accumulate my rewards, which are automatically claimed.
 I never trade NFT or receive any other tokens this community created a while back. 
 If my stake pool is gonna give Sundaeswap token as well, how will I receive it and in which part of the wallet will I see ut? What should I do to make sure it&#x27;s gonna be in my wallet? Do I need to add asset too?
 Thank you for the help.

                    <span>Hi, a pair of days ago got my first Cardano tokens. I used a Wallet called Metamask, where i could use my Trezor T. Recently, i read that you could get your cardano working for you by a method called &quot;staking&quot;.
 How can i &quot;stake&quot; my cardano thought Metamask? I cannot find anything related :(
 I was thinking about using another wallet, but metamask was the only available wallet i could use with Trezor T and Binance Smart Chain tokens like cardano. If you know another wallet where i can stake my cardano and works with Trezor T, please tell me.
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>I own an Engineering company, and we mainly do engineering reports of buildings, machines and other items where we determine the market value, remaining economic life of the assets, etc. Most of our clients are other businesses, auditing companies, government agencies and the like. Most of are reports are used to assist and justify decision making, such as accepting real estate as collateral for loans, if a machine should or not be replaced, to register the actual market value for accounting purposes, ect. I thought I could register our reports in the cardano blockchain to have more traceability, but I am sure there are other uses for the technology I am not seeing. Does anybody have any ideas?

 Could anyone explain that?

                    <span>I used to have 3k cardano and spent them as the downpayment to buying an investment property overseas. The transaction was faster than wire transfers which took another week for the money to come through and cheaper as well. I didn&#x27;t want to but had no choice and I still made quite a profit from the original purchase price.
 Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t go back in due to the price a couple of weeks ago but now again got 500 ADA or so during this sale.
 I invested in ETH based alt coins to try them and its just insane, the fees, the complexity, the fleecing by brokers due to not having an official wallet.
 I have come to the conclusion that my other alt coins are there mostly to make money while Cardano is the one I truly see being a real currency the way crypto was meant to be.

                    <span>I sent some ADA to KuCoin from AdaLite over 2 hours ago (roughly 300 confirmations by now) but KuCoin is still not showing it. 
 Clearly this is a problem with Kucoin. Even BTC transactions usually show up faster than this with KuCoin. 
 Do any of you have experience with depositing (or withdrawing) ADA with KuCoin, and is it usually this slow?

                    <span>As I understand it, current Ouroboros on Shelley uses Nakamoto consensus. Hydra will bring in fast finality but is it the newer BFT protocol? If not should we upgrade Ouroboros to BFT like we had with Byron?
 I’m not an expert on any of this , just been doing some reading in the last few days.

                    <span>My Daedalus wallet was acting up a bit so I installed Yoroi as a browser extension. After restoring the Daedalus wallet in Yoroi, I saw three columns:
  
Total ADA (e.g. 10), Total rewards (e.g. 01) , Total delegated ADA (e.g. 10).
  
&quot;Total rewards&quot; comes with a button to withdraw rewards into the total. I did it, and paid the fee for doing so.
 Now the Yoroi wallet balance reads: 
  
Total ADA e.g. 11, Total rewards 0 and total delegated ADA e.g. 11.
  
The problem is that switching back to Daedalus, all I see is Total ADA e.g. 11.
 In other words, according to Yoroi, my wallet&#x27;s rewards do not compound automatically: I have to pay a fee in order to add the earned rewards to my stake-pool-delegated principle.
 So... what&#x27;s going on? Which one of the two representations of the same wallet is true? The Daedalus one? Or the Yoroi one?
 Do rewards automatically compound in Daedalus?
 Or not?

                    <span>When we invest a new startup, one of the main factor is to look into the team behind the project.
 Astarter, which backed by Cardano stakeholders-Emurgo, to build Defi Hub on Cardano for user and developers.Emurgo provides socially impactful solutions through tech development &amp; investment.
 with support from Emurgo, Astarter is equipped with everything that is needed to meet the surging demand of startup in the Cardano system.
 Astarter consist of 4 core applications: 
 1.Launchpad
 2.Dex
 3.Lending &amp; Borrowing 
 4.Tech Service Platform
 According to the roadmap, Astarter will have it IDO in coming weeks and to launch its laundpad in Q1 2022 and the team published its weekly technical update, its seem on tracks. 
 I believe this project will be a huge launch to Cardano ecosystem as the ecosystem is still in very early stage compared to its huge user base.

 Let&#x27;s go...
 Newly covered today:
  
Seeing reports that Cardano’s 24 hour volume recently exceeded Ethereum! https://twitter.com/cardano_daily/status/1460238659098005504
 We’ve seen a very nice and steady rise in transactions over the last 15 days! https://twitter.com/WillyzPortico/status/1460221046112456704
 The January Haskell class in Ghana will include 80 students! https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1460259961313837058
  
Previously Covered but still interesting:
  
In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano. https://twitter.com/seal_kiman/status/1443593563846193155

                    <span>I saw this post on twitter, apparently they&#x27;ve developed an SDK that allows anyone to construct minting transactions offline using Javascript and CSL that can be submitted via blockfrost:
 https://twitter.com/lovadaart/status/1460322409446313992?s&#x3D;20
 This could be a game changer for developers like me who don&#x27;t want to run a node (I&#x27;ve tried using the docker containers, but in AWS the machine required to run my node costs hundreds of dollars a month!) I&#x27;ve also tried constructing these transactions manually using CSL and it&#x27;s not a trivial task. I&#x27;ve been waiting for something like this to come out and wanted to share so that they can get some more interest since I&#x27;d love to see this become a reality!

                    <span>Want to let the community know that Tesla is hiring Haskell software developers for internship and full time positions. Haskell has been used in production for years and we&#x27;re actively growing the team. If you&#x27;re interested in applying please use one of the following links:
 Full Time: https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/software-engineer-data-tools-82891
 Spring Internships: https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/software-engineering-internship-spring-2022-98585
 Summer Internships: https://www.tesla.com/careers/search/job/software-engineering-internship-summer-2022-105729
 Also, please send us an email at &quot;vehiclesoftwarerecruiting at tesla&quot; and let us know you saw this post.
 A few frequently asked questions:
  
US work authorization required
 The full time position is in Palo Alto, CA, not remote
 Internships can be remote, but preferred to be on-site (it&#x27;s more fun, anyway!)
 We&#x27;re looking for candidates with 1-3 years experience developing Haskell (or an equivalent functional programming language) in a production environment. This is a flexible requirement but that is the ideal candidate.

                    <span>One of the common complaints with the Haskell ecosystem is the existence of libraries with little expository documentation. Sometimes these libraries are quite useful and, in fact, are part of the mind space of the more seasoned members of the community. Yet, for a newcomer such libraries can seem impenetrable. Yet is all hope lost? The code is there after all. That’s the documentation, right!?
 What are your strategies for familiarizing yourself (to the point of pragmatic proficiency) with a sparsely documented library? 
 Do you have any stories or tales of a time when you achieved something “great” in such a case?

 TLDR; ghci won&#x27;t store/reload your command history unless you set $XDG_DATA_HOME appropriately; due to a bug.

                    <span>For context: I’ve been using Haskell for about five years now, and loving it. I consider myself a relatively intermediate Haskeller, insofar as I understand and regularly use the more advanced parts of GHC. Though I rarely use it in production (as almost all my programming is for personal projects of interest), I find myself extremely productive in Haskell, and can generally get GHC to do what I want.
 Except when what I want is good performance. It’s not that I don’t know about laziness: I know what it is and (roughly) how it works, and I take advantage of it often enough. It’s not that I’m unaware of space leaks: if the profiler shows a great big triangle shape, or my program slows down as it runs, those are usually pretty good signs that I have one.

                    <span>I am on a sabbatical to reevaluate priorities in my life and decided to finally take a deep dive on the language after knowing about many years ago.
 It&#x27;s been a daily lesson on humility. For most other languages, one week of studies at the end of a work day plus the whole weekend would be enough to have a firm grasp of its fundamentals and make decent stuff. But with Haskell it&#x27;s been three weeks from monday to monady and it is kicking me hard on the butt, nuts, teeth and anyplace else that hurts. I think this is more related to the way I think as an imperative programmer (more than OO or even immutability) than being a difficult language. Maybe it is a difficult language. I don&#x27;t kow.
 I really liked the language. I like its simplicity and expressivity while not losing rigor with types. …</span>

                    <span>Let&#x27;s say I am working on multiple Haskell projects, some of them using cabal as the main build system, some of them using Stack, some of them are just libraries, some also have executables, and they don&#x27;t all always use the same version of GHC (that changes through time of course). Some of these projects are mine, some are not mine and I am contributing via a fork.
 What is the best way to maintain my tools/toolchain so that I can easily switch between the projects without too much hassle?
 Specifically, the things I find tricky is:
 - Ensuring I use the correct version of &#x60;stan&#x60;, since it needs to be compiled with the same version of GHC as the project.- Ensuring I use the correct version of &#x60;hls&#x60;, since it needs to be compiled with the same version of GHC as the project.

 As part of my DD, I like looking at the total value locked (TVL) for the blockchains.
 I am unable to find this information for Cardano? Anyone that could help me?

                    <span>So I have an idea in mind that I think would be interesting in terms of a wallet.
 Some of the issue with wallets is the trade off between security and usable funds.
 Problem Statement If I have a wallet connected to a ledger, every time I want to spend something I have to get my ledger out, doodle with it, use it, and then put it away securely JUST for a 5 Ada transaction. The trade off with using this device is I don’t want to lose all my Ada and still want to be more secure. But having to get my ledger every time will stop me from transacting as much or using Ada in the future.
 Solution Introduce skimming. What if there was a two wallet system that managed the trade off between both security and transacting.
  
Imagine two wallets: Wallet Savings Account and Wallet Transaction Account

                    <span>I was drawn to Cardano by the tokenomics and promise of decentralization. I noticed almost all the projects I see have a certain allocation (sometimes a big one) for VC money to get in before the rest of us. I’m sure there are reasons, but it’s always a major turn off for me. It doesn’t feel fair that institutional investors get in early at a lower price just because they are rich. Even projects using ISPO’s still take VC money. I thought the point of an ISPO was so that they could raise funds without having to go that route. 
 Is there something I’m missing here? Is it really totally impossible to make a successful project without taking VC money? Are there any good projects that are not taking any institutional money?

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been away for a while and saw that there has been a recent hardfork (Alonzo). Does this mean that I have alonzo coins somewhere else if I held ADA in my Daedalus wallet? If so, how do I get them?

                    <span>I have some technical questions concerning the proposed projects on the Cardano ecosystem. I&#x27;m not expressing criticism, I&#x27;m merely an agnostic concerning the really technical coding &amp; architectural stuff.
 So, more and more countries are becoming interested in implementing digital solutions to citizen verification issues, among these solutions are blockchain solutions. I understood Ethiopia already signed some kind of memorandum of understanding with Cardano (Hoskinson), with Burundi being the latest country interested in utilizing the Cardano network for these things. However, I do have some questions.
 How would this technically take place? Can a dictatorial regime implement verification systems that are inherently immutable? If so, how does this immutability take place? If, for example…</span>

 Let&#x27;s go...
 Newly covered today: 
  
Pavia dropped a more detailed roadmap with live events scheduled for the plaza in Q3 2022. https://twitter.com/Pavia_io/status/1459246398046674945
 Charles is back in Colorado and has dropped a full AMA. https://youtu.be/nnDWc6uP6gs
 The November mid-month IOHK Development Update is now out! https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1459250049414799368
  
Previously Covered but still interesting:
  
In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano. https://twitter.com/seal_kiman/status/1443593563846193155

 It would be a big boom for us if we can show community demand / support.

 BitRefill is a website (bitrefill.com) that allows users to use BTC to purchase giftcards from popular merchants or vendors such as Amazon, Walmart, Ebay etc.

                    <span>Hi guys, I am working on a project and I want to gather peoples opinions and Ideas. 
 What is it?
 It is an RPG board game that I am looking at implementing an app that goes alongside the game. The board game will be a series of different games that all use the same statistics and players can use characters between the games. With the App, it will be used to keep players statistics through the game but the reason I am posting it here is because I am looking at using NFTs on Cardano so that players can purchase new characters on the app. This will let players play the board games with your NFT characters. Maybe later also bring them to video games.
 Cardano NFTs
 In using NFTs some characters will be rare and some will be common and even some unique, players can buy, trade and sell their ch…</span>

                    <span>I&#x27;m really loving how the roadmap for 2022 Cardano is coming together. It&#x27;s a living ecosystem, growing, refining, adapting, and becoming stronger. The technology is unbelievable and we have so many great innovations coming to meet the hundreds of projects building on Cardano

                    <span>Is anyone creating some version of HEX on Cardano? We need this! Or at least we should have it. Obviously not with the huge amount to the founder, but something more fair, and with a website where people can see a graph of penalties paid. I really like the pumpamentals. People buy and stake to prevent dilution, and people who don&#x27;t stake are diluted, which means that stakers will have a larger percentage wise amount of tokens. And if people unstake too early, then stakers win even more, because of the penalties paid for unstaking too early. Also very limited supply, so the price can skyrocket, which will give an incentive to unstake early(to sell the token), which means more penalties paid and more for stakers. What&#x27;s not to like?
 Please someone make this. It is way better than stupid meme tokens, and I guess kinda easy to make compared to other projects. :-)

 How can I get my coins back? I have the transaction data in my history.

 Thinking of getting in on the ADALend private sale (it&#x27;s still on). What are your thoughts on it?
 Also, would be great if you could share your DYOR conclusions if you can, as I start doing mine.
 Thanks!

                    <span>Maybe you also missed this Summit news video: Bitrue exchange announced that ADA is becoming on of their base pairs. 
 And they will list Cardano DApps coins. 
 Does anyone has an account at Bitrue and can verify that ADA is now a base pair on their exchange ? 
 Not sure if it has something to do with that ADA acts as a stablecoin the last weeks. But a base pair coin has to be very stable . 
 Here the video https://youtu.be/NBLkaV7jH50 I just stumbled on .

                    <span>Is there any published data showing area were most of the ADA transactions are created? I would like to know if having nodes in those location (lower latency) help your stakepool? 
 Example, To me it does not make sense to have 2 relay nodes in same city. Seems better to spread them out..
 Any other thoughts?
 Thanks

                    <span>It&#x27;s my understanding that the max saturation limit for a stake pool is 64M.
 Does this mean when the pool we&#x27;re staking our ADA with reaches 64M, we need to manually find a new pool? Thanks!

                    <span>I’m not sure if this is possible and I suspect that this is a no, but is there anyway to link my app to my Trezor hardware wallet overview.
 Ideally I’d like to keep an eye on the amount and that which is being staked through through the APP.
 Fully aware I won’t be able to actually change or remove anything which connecting the Trezor to the laptop and moving it manually, however being able to see thing will always be nice.
 Anyone reading this thinking - I’m gonna pm the noob for their keys or tell him they need to be transferred somewhere else, please jog on. It’ll just be another account on the block and report list. 
 I’m not sure if I’m being really stupid but I can’t see an easy way to do this. Thanks in advance for your help 👌🏼

                    <span>Hello,
 I am looking to partner with someone to help build a DAO on Cardano. This person would be in charge of the technical side of the project. This project is ambitious, and I know this is a large task on any developer who answers this call. 
 The idea is rather simple. Users stake their Cardano within our DAO. In return, users earn our token. The DAO will keep the Cardano staking rewards. Then, users can use our token to vote on which non-profits / charities the DAO will donate the staking rewards to.
 A little bit about me, I have experience as a software project manager, and I have been involved in crypto for several years. 
 Thank you to anyone who shows interest in joining me on this venture. I welcome any feedback or questions about the project in the comments section.
 Regards,
 ExcelsiorDAO

                    <span>So I want to learn how to mint native tokens on Cardano, specifically NFTs so I can start working on some ideas I have for NFT projects. I followed a guide to install a node on a VM (Ubuntu) and everything went fine until I let my laptop synch with the blockchain and while it was synching windows decided to make a random update and now I have some issues running it again. I have lost motivation about running it on my laptop, which maybe wasn&#x27;t the ideal choice because of the limited 8 GB ram it has. 
 Anyway I have a good PC with better specs but I have windows, can somebody give me some direction on a way to install and run a Cardano node and cli on Windows or is it just not a good option? I have Daedalus installed and that is a node from what I have read so can it save me time from installing a node or even synching with the blockchain? Sorry for the noob questions I&#x27;m still learning about this and remember all of this is just because I want to play around with minting my own nft&#x27;s.

                    <span>Hello Cardano developers,
 Some of you, including me, may feel that Haskell is very different from imperative programming languages. As a Python developer who got into Haskell because of Cardano, when learning this language, I could still see that Haskell, despite being very different, shares quite a lot similarities with Python. 
 As a practice and a form of learning reinforcement, I created a project, py2hs, to document how some frequently used programming patterns (e.g. functor, applicative) are implemented in Python and Haskell respectively. If you are a Python developer who just started learning Haskell, hope you can find this material helpful in some way.
 In terms of future development, I will keep improving existing contents and adding more examples as time allowed. Also, any contributions from the community is more than welcome. Hope we can together make it a better learning material and help more Cardano developers!
 Jerry

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m having a terrible time with haskell. I&#x27;m taking a class in college, office hours are offered but only when I&#x27;m working and i can&#x27;t make it in for help during them. I&#x27;m looking for someone available in the evenings 7 or later EST. The first topic I&#x27;m looking for guidance in would be parsing. 
 Thanks

                    <span>Hey there,
 currently I&#x27;m trying to learn Haskell but I am a person that depends heavily on exercises or practicing
 their newly acquired knowledge. I&#x27;m following learn you a Haskell and Real world Haskell but
 I&#x27;d like to get more experience and knowledge by doing exercises..
 Could someone point me in the right direction and to some exercises or old homeworks?
 Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Data.Vector.Unboxed essentially gives a Structure of Arrays representation - Vector (a,b) can be stored as (Vector a, Vector b). 
 This has some minor issues - deriving doesn&#x27;t really work, writing the typeclass by hand is really annoying, GHC cannot optimize away dead reads if you only use one field - but overall it&#x27;s a reasonably nice and composable abstraction.
 I&#x27;m currently playing with some code which accepts messages and must store them efficiently before they get batch-executed. To make this extensible I&#x27;d like some freer monads, more extensible effects style interface, composing the command enum like Either Op1 Op2.
 But my usecase could be seen as a mildly wonky Op-Based CRDT which means the operations commute and order doesn&#x27;t matter. It would be really nice if internally I could store everything as (MVector Op1, MVector Op2)behind the scenes.
 This lead me to a number of questions:
  
Is there an array-of-sums representation that stores Vector (Either Op1 Op2) as (Vector Op1, Vector Op2)?
 Is there a better way to derive unboxed vector boilerplate? I have seen https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-th-unbox-0.2.2/docs/Data-Vector-Unboxed-Deriving.html before but it feels like DerivingVia should be able to handle it if the monad was constrained to be representational
 Are there interface ideas to manipulate unboxed vectors structurally? Say, lift projection functions like Vector (a,b) -&gt; Vector a? In my case also things like pop one Op1 value, or take all Op2 values
 Is there an approach to structurally manipulate types in Haskell? Most code in Haskell only folds over the generic representation but e.g. StrictCheck has some tooling to add a functor at each level of a type, typescript has a bunch of tools for this like
  
 
type ExtractPII &#x3D; { [Property in keyof Type]: Type[Property] extends { pii: true } ? true : false; }; 
 If people have ideas to any of these points I&#x27;d really like to hear about them!

                    <span>Hello, I am working on two functions that filter values from a list of Cupcake type objects, and I am getting a &quot;Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive&quot; error when running them, which causes any example I try on them to give me *** Exception: Assessed3.hs:(25,1)-(31,67): Non-exhaustive patterns in function priceRange.
 I really don&#x27;t see anything wrong:
 priceRange :: Price -&gt; Price -&gt; [Cupcake] -&gt; [Cupcake]
 priceRange minprice maxprice [] &#x3D; []
 priceRange minprice maxprice [CC p i] &#x3D; [CC p i | pricelower minprice p, pricelower p maxprice]
 where
 pricelower :: Price -&gt; Price -&gt; Bool
 pricelower (P x) (P y) 
 | x&lt;&#x3D;y &#x3D; True
 | otherwise &#x3D; False
 Assessed3.hs:25:1: warning: [-Wincomplete-patterns]
 Pattern match(es) are non-exhaustive
 In an equation for ‘priceRange’:
 Patterns not matched:
 (P _) (P _) ((CC (P _) []):_:_)
 (P _) (P _) ((CC (P _) (_:_)):_:_)
 |
 25 | priceRange minprice maxprice [] &#x3D; [] 
 For this it says I didn&#x27;t match the two cases in which the list inside is empty or non empty but I really don&#x27;t see how that will give me an error.

 parameter and then passing the resulting function on to a map or a filter. &quot;
 I saw this: https://stackoverflow.com/q/14397128/9481613
 But what are some use cases?

                    <span>Bezos fanboys come across as particularly pathetic. Saw someone shaming people for hoping Bezos’ penis rocket exploded, asking us “how would you feel if it was your rocketship” without a hint of irony. 
 By far the worst tho are people who assume that anyone who hates rich people is just jealous of them.
 Anyway, billionaires aren’t human and their heads belong on spikes. I sincerely hope we break out the guillotine for them in my lifetime.
 Kill the rich. They aren’t human and they don’t deserve our kindness or sympathy.

                    <span>Haskell’s laziness gives us
great
benefits,
but comes with costs.
One of the most visible cost of laziness is hard to predict memory behavior, and so we
have, and need, tools to profile and measure the heap of our Haskell programs.
Most of the time, we live in a high-level world of type classes, monoids, and
isomorphisms. But at the end of the day our code needs to run on actual
machines, and when our code is run it needs to be performant. Typically, “be
performant”, means “have reasonable computational complexity” and so we usually
focus on good asymptotic behavior instead of constant costs. But when our
programs meet our CPUs, constant costs are important, and thus having low level
tools is helpful for low level optimizations, i.e., when you want to squeeze
that last 10% out of your prog…</span>
