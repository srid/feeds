                    <span>I have worked in many different fields(web dev, analytics, product management) but can&#x27;t seem to stick to one. Is it about the field or something about myself that I need to change? How do I go about solving this??

                    <span>I made a similar post last year at this time and, again, I am in my office on Christmas morning.
There are a few days every year that really show which jobs are vital and which can be left aside for a day.  I started my car this morning (-32, -40 with wind chill).  On my way to work I drove past a hospital and a care home, both were manned.  The dairy farm had its lights on.  A cop with his flashers drove past me on the way to some emergency.  The macdonalds drive-through was open too.  I had to be at work by 0600, but I was relieving someone who had been sitting in another office since 1800.  On my computer were the same dozen emails I get every morning, each from someone else who drew the short straw.
There aren&#x27;t many of us on HN that work weekends let alone Christmas morning, but If you too are sitting in a dark office remember that all across the world are millions of other people working the truly important jobs.

                    <span>Many people have the feeling that Cardano Foundation has been operating in a black box and it is difficult to know what they are doing. Fortunately, Cardano Foundation is aware of this and has been trying to be more connected with the community. 
 This Dumpling Twitter Space welcomed the CEO (Frederik Gregaard) and Head of Marketing (David Taylor aka DT) from the Cardano Foundation. The goal is to share progress/insights and to connect with the community. 
 This is Frederikâs first-ever Twitter Space, Iâm honored and excited that he joined us. Frederik and DT shared insights about regulation, marketing, a recap of 2021, successes of the Foundation in 2021, and plans for 2022. Later the floor was open for audience questions, many community members asked amazing questions. 
 A huge thank you to Frederik and DT for taking the time to talk to the community, and as you can hear from the recording, they have been forming great partnerships for Cardano. Big shoutout to everybody at the Foundation, look forward to a prosperous 2022 for Cardano.

                    <span>I am relatively new to cardano and I have recently set up my Yoroi wallet and transferred my ada to it.
 I was going to stake my ada but all the pools Iâve seen, I think you need to pay 340 ada to stake with the pool.
 Iâm a very small fish but say there is a 5% annual return, you would need to stake 6,800 ADA to make back your initial cost in a year, which is a pretty long timeframe just to break even. And to be locked into the pool for.
 Am I understanding this correctly? 
 Thanks so much.

                    <span>I have a little Cardano saved up which I am staking from Yoroi on my mobile. its roughly 372 ADA. Recently a typhoon devasted our area and flooded our house. quite simply put we lost a lot, a real lot. I have a little saved up in the bank which could help but it is not enough, so I decided to sell my ADA. I was a fool and a noob, I factory reset my phone to try and fix ghost touch that appeared recently. I didnt know that doing that erases the saved Yoroi wallet. It installed Yoroi again, but now I need to restore the old wallet. Here is where the problem begins, I had my seed phrased stored in 3 different &quot;places&quot;. 1) my laptop 2) my mobile and 3) in a paper i stuck in a book in the library at our house. 1) the laptop got destroyed by the flood. 2) the saved file got deleted by factory reset 3) everything is flooded in the house so its gone now. It was my last hope. Is there really no other way to restore the wallet? i have the password, the pin but I dont have the seed phrase. I really hope someone knows how and hope its really possible.

                    <span>What is so special about Cardano that truly sets it a part? 
 Iâve heard a lot about MTV in the recent days and I was wondering how these two stack up against one another?
 In general Iâm also just wondering how they stack up against all other chains. There are SO MANY now, that it is a bit mind boggling to even figure out what-is-what. The information overload is prettyâ¦ yeah.
 âââââââââ
 Added: I still donât understand the underlying backbone of blockchain, so any more technical/scholarly explanations are welcomed. As I have found intro/basic YouTube resources very unhelpful for the most part.
 Thanks in advance for any thoughts or resources!

                    <span>So I am in the process of installing Daedalus wallet on my machine; Some questions I have ...
  
I understand it is a full node wallet, but does this also mean that if I keep my laptop on, will I also be running a Cardano node?
 Below screenshot is from my installation; is my hardware sufficient? what happens if I keep this setup, and lets say after a year and the full blockchain data volume increases significantly?

 pretty sure I remember my password but haven&#x27;t tried in a while
 I just spilled all over those recovery words it gave me at first
 What should I do? Guessing I should set up a new dae wallet now to get new recovery words right before a decade passes and it&#x27;s gone forever. If so, can anyone ELI5 on how to do that?
 Thank you!

Where I send the asset to an address with a designated amount of ADA. I have the NFT in a Yorio wallet and I can only send with 1 ADA. How do I change the amount of ADA in the asset sending transaction? Or do I need to send token to different wallet to do this? Thanks.

                    <span>Merry Xmas everyone 
 â
 I am trying to set up a node in order to support the network but it is proving to be a major undertaking even though I have &#x27;some&#x27; skills in Linux server administration.
 I followed each and every instruction found in the developers&#x27; documentation found here
 https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/installing-cardano-node/
 but I have a suspicion that I haven&#x27;t completely mastered that task since the cardano-node service is not found even though the cardano-node is running
 The output looks like this

                    <span>Hi. Has anyone noticed much lower staking rewards lately?
 I am staking in Bloom2 which is only at a Saturation level of 60%. But lately rewards have come down quite sharply over the past 5 epochs.
 I know it oscillates with luck etc, but never had such a long spell with less than average rewards.
 Is this only a Bloom2 thing or is it more generalized?
 Cheers

                    <span>The guys on archlinux subs just say &#x27;check the code yourself bro&#x27; and get testy if you ask what you are supposed to look for.
 I have no idea what would be rogue code from not except for looking at the source&#x3D; urls and seeing something untoward there.
 So could those with a better eye for such things confirm/deny if the packages are safe to use?
 I was told by the arch guys that I should not build from the official site and rather prefer the aur packages (after auditing) because it will mean the packages stay up to date. I thought that the risk of using non official packages outweighed that risk but they say no and to use them once I have audited them, which I don&#x27;t know how to do confidently.

 All my transactions are now failed.
 The status of a recent transaction is as follows:
 &quot;Failed. 100254 confirmations&quot;
 The transaction definitely went through and it was properly displayed previously. Not sure, why Yoroi now decides, that the transaction failed.

                    <span>Hey guys, 
 Recently I created an Yoroi wallet for purposes of staking my ADA. I&#x27;ve succesfully set it up, sent my ADA to it, but now I&#x27;m trying to access it from my second PC. I have all the needed stuff (name, phrase, PWs), but when I go to recover the wallet, in the last step it asks me to input a new password. For now, I used a Phantom wallet and it allowed me to log in normally with phrase and a password, on Yoroi it seems like its asking for a new password. If I enter a new password, I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll get logged out of my first PC? I&#x27;m fairly new to wallets and DEXes so it might sound noobish but...is it even possible to have Yoroi logged in on multiple machines?
 Thanks in advance and all the best during the holidays!

                    <span>Hello everyone,I am a UX designer who has been working on a project to push the reality of a decentralized web 3.0
 My project started from something small, a quick simpler solution for VRchat users to create their avatars and upload them into this amazing social platform.
 One of the first thoughts I had was creating a more intuitive 3D modeling platform via cloud computing which will directly export creations into VRchat. However, as I started to dig deeper in my research and interviewed multiple different users this project scope grew.
 Different use cases from this community required different solutions aside from a 3D modeling platform, for some required a marketplace to get VR assets, some wanted to gain more knowledge and others to share theirs, and for many others, they wanted a plâ¦</span>

                    <span>Hello)
 I am intrigued by the Project catalyst and I would really like to participate in the upcoming voting. As I can see there is a minimum of 500 ADA to participate. My question can I use my 500 ADA which are staked in Daedalus for the registration, or only non-staked ADA can by used?
 By the way Merry Christmas to all)

                    <span>I used to have no problem syncing daedalus wallet on my 8gb RAM laptop once a week. Over time it&#x27;s using more and more RAM. It now uses all my RAM, runs like a slug, takes hours and i can&#x27;t use any other application while daedalus syncing. Have daedalus system requirements recently changed from 8gb to 16gb RAM? any advice? Guess I&#x27;m not using daedalus anymore. 
 Is my selected staking pool and ledger wallet all just as accessible on yoroi wallet?

                    <span>idk if its the right forum(im new here) but anyway , I had an idea about the double spending problem and needed someone to tell me if its already exist or what we can do about that. So when person A who has X amount send a transaction(T) to person B, before this transaction enter the waiting to be validated pool the protocol checking if person A has X-T amount and if not this transaction automatically canceled so only true transactions can get to enter the waiting pool.

                    <span>The guys on archlinux subs just say &#x27;check the code yourself bro&#x27; and get testy if you ask what you are supposed to look for.
 I have no idea what would be rogue code from not except for looking at the source&#x3D; urls and seeing something untoward there.
 So could those with a better eye for such things confirm/deny if the packages are safe to use?
 I was told by the arch guys that I should not build from the official site and rather prefer the aur packages (after auditing) because it will mean the packages stay up to date. I thought that the risk of using non official packages outweighed that risk but they say no and to use them once I have audited them, which I don&#x27;t know how to do confidently.

 data (,) a b &#x3D; (,) a b 
 At first sight, it seems circular. But then it works
 Î»&gt; (,) 1 2 (1,2) 
 I found this, but then I don&#x27;t follow how Solo is/becomes (,). I understand that (,) is a product type since it&#x27;s definitely not a sum type of any sort. Can someone point me to some details on the whole product type theory, as well as how the (,) data type definition results in the two arguments being surrounded in parens and separated by a comma, and treated as a tuple.

                    <span>I haven&#x27;t really made any effort to collect any tokens othere than Ada, but with Sundaeswap coming out, it gained my interest, and now I want to start collecting through staking. So my question is if someone can point me to a compiled list of pools? Also another question, with Gens, they&#x27;re pools fee is 99% + the standard 340; so does that basically mean I won&#x27;t be getting Ada rewards except for the 1%, but get gens tokens instead?

                    <span>Why i thought of this is due to majority of people here afraid of : what will happen if I die? How i can have kyc (know your customer) attached so Ada can be transferred to family member. How to use it offline at merchant without having access to wallet or internet while travelling ?
 So what could be done is engage governments and existing banks into Crypto currency structure. 
 Users can get paper print from bank from their fiat or crypto currency savings account. For eg. I have 100 Ada in my account and I am traveling to other country i can take out print of 50 Ada scannable code or passkey to use that amount of Ada where merchant can just scan it via their app and customer can pay with this paper rather than Cash. Merchant can accept in Ada or in fiat directly via this page and relative fiat conversion charges can be applied. 
 Other than this all Ada account holders can have Pager like device for OTP which will be connected via satellite so even if someone has paper they can&#x27;t utilise without using this pager device + transaction password by customer. 
 Also via Ada wallet it will always require this OTP plus password to start transaction. Customer can get new pager of old is lost or stolen via bank or verified partners. Meanwhile Bank branches which partners with Ada foundation will host their own stake pool as well. Many other things can be added to this basic functionality. 
 This is only for those who don&#x27;t mind submitting their KYC and identity.

                    <span>Very short question. So stakepools for their ISO have been announced last month and they said that ISO and DEX will be launched together so I guess there is still time. But would there be a date upto which we can stake with these pools to earn Sundaeswap tokens or I have to stake right now? From where the time will be counted, from the date of the pool selection or from the future date when they will announce ISO?
 And before anyone pointsout, I did post this in Sundaeswap subreddit but didn&#x27;t receive any answer.

                    <span>Hello guys. I was just curious about stable coins and was wondering if someone has an answer. If we use a stable coin that is stable because it follows the US-Dollar or the Euro, doesn&#x27;t that mean that this same stable coin gets affected from inflation and everything else? And if so are the only true stable coin options the one that reflect gold as a value?

                    <span>Hi guys,
 An update for SingularityNET holders, Cardano enthusiasts, and those who are interested in joining.
 Some further good news for AGIX this December: Its ERC-20 converter test-net is now live and operable. This is cool news, and as usual with Cardano partners - impressive technology. Although it probably won&#x27;t get too much use in these crazy market conditions. https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/12/07/the-agix-erc20-converter-testnet-is-now-live/?s&#x3D;09
 Also Airdrop for AGIX holders - NTX tokens incoming. snapshot of wallet addresses on Jan 5th - 2022.

 Hosting the AI data marketplace of the Cardano ecosystem is a monumental task. Airdrop potentials in these massive future-looking projects are so dope to me. ADA is a behemoth - and this is how it will interact with AI - through AGIX and its accompanying system of tokens like SDAO and NuNet (NTX).
 Hope all the Cardanians, and everyone else a very excellent end of the year and Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Hannukah, and Winter Solstice to all of you.

 My real questions are ;
 1)What ADA projects You looking into? Either NFTS or even Dapps?
 2) Any Specific ADA Metaverse projects you are researching or looking into? saw a ad for SKYMON nft being the first live ada nft in metaverse...

                    <span>So, just so I cover my bases and continue to ask questions, and I know these questions are probably for a tax advisor, but hope this community can answer...
 Pretend I bought 100 ADA coins.
 I stake them. And continue to earn 5% interest.
 I am assuming I won&#x27;t get tax, since I didn&#x27;t really achieve capital gain (I achieve capital gain when I sell into fiat USD?)
 Anything else I need to know regarding taxes specifically dealing with Cardano?

 Thanks!

                    <span>GâDay mates!
 Iâve been in the community for a while but this is my first post. I started to delegate ADA few epoch ago and joined a genius yield pool to earn some GENS.
 My question is: If the pool gets saturated, do we stop earning GENS? As far as Iâm concerned, if a pool gets saturated you stop getting rewards. But in this case, being a 100% GENS reward, maybe is different. 
 Cheers and have a good one

                    <span>Can someone clearly explain to me that since Iâve been staking the last 7 months in a pool that is on the:
 âSundaeSwap &#x27;Initial Stakepool Offering&#x27; (ISO) Stakepoolâ as itâs stated on the pools website 
 Do I just keep my ADA here or do I have to stake it somewhere else for better rewards and air drops?
 I appreciate the information!

                    <span>I know you can stake your ADA coins towards ISPO and the rewards are often the token of said project. Then once you receive the tokens, what is the value or use? Or how have people been using their tokens?

                    <span>Hello,
 I am a Cardano enthusiast trying to mint some NFTs on the Cardano network and test some of its functionalities out. Please excuse me if this sounds really stupid as I have a little coding experience. I had a questions which I wasn&#x27;t sure where to ask about. 
 Let&#x27;s just say I had 100 NFTs minted and sent to 100 different wallets as a raffle ticket to win a PS5. I select the winner and announce that its #11 NFT. Now let&#x27;s say person A is the winner and DMs me and say she has the winning NFT. How can I actually verify this person is the #11 NFT holder? 
 Because I&#x27;m thinking that lets Person B sees the announcement before person A, so person B looks up the #11 NFT on cardanoscan and see all the necessary information to pretend like Person A? 
 So I&#x27;m thinking the only way to verify the winner is if Person A send shipping information and is it only confirmed when Person A send back the #11 NFT(winning) back to me so I know it&#x27;s that person wallet and I ship out the winning prize. Is that the logic? I feel like I&#x27;m overcomplicating things.

                    <span>Please bear with me, I&#x27;m only starting to learn haskell. (Note: My machine is a M1 Macbook Air)
 Recently, after following a guide and installing haskell and necessary stuff from here, I tried to compile a small program and found out that I needed to install LLVM, I did it and by trial-and-error I managed to get everything working, but though it works, if I run GHCi I get this message.

One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined. 
 *edit: just after posting this, when I launched GHCi again, this didn&#x27;t happen, but yesterday at first this took place, then it didn&#x27;t and today it did again
 Do you know what&#x27;s responsible for it? What should I do?

                    <span>I&#x27;m happy to announce that text-2.0 with UTF-8 underlying representation has been finally released: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0. The release is identical to rc2, circulated earlier.
 Changelog: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-2.0/changelog
 Please give it a try. Here is a cabal.project template: https://gist.github.com/Bodigrim/9834568f075be36a1c65e7aaba6a15db
 This work would not be complete without a blazingly-fast UTF-8 validator, submitted by Koz Ross into bytestring-0.11.2.0, whose contributions were sourced via HF as an in-kind donation from MLabs. I would like to thank Emily Pillmore for encouraging me to take on this project, helping with the proposal and permissions. I&#x27;m grateful to my fellow text maintainers, who&#x27;ve been carefully reviewing my work in course of the last six months, as well as helpful and responsive maintainers of downstream packages and GHC developers. Thanks all, it was a pleasant journey!

                    <span>I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the way parallel list comprehensions are desugared, so I filed a ticket suggesting an alternative approach. It wasn&#x27;t very warmly received, unfortunately. So I thought about it a little more, and realized that the desugaring is totally broken in some cases.

                    <span>When providing a type to users, a library can also provide lenses for that type without actually depending on lens. This is because Lens is a type synonym, so you can simply write a function with the correct signature and export it, to be used like a Lens. And even though there is a wide variety of lens packages (lens, optics, microlens, etc.) such a function is likely to work with most of them.
 This is all preamble to my actual question: how can a library do the same for streams? There are a number of streaming libraries out there (conduit, pipes, streaming, streamly, etc.) and a hypothetical library author would might like to provide streams or stream combinators to users that are compatible with as many of them as possible, but don&#x27;t explicitly rely on those libraries. Does anyone have any information about what this could look like (assuming its even possible)?

                    <span>TL;DR: Game made with apecs and gloss crashes when trying to read input from Nintendo Switch.
 Inspired by this post, I am recreating the Unity 2D tutorial in Haskell using apecs and apecs-gloss. I am nearly done: The graphics are rendered correctly, the levels are generated appropriately, the player responds to keyboard input, etc.
 As an extra, I want to be able to control the game with the Nintendo Switch joy cons. I have successfully connected the joy cons and I&#x27;m reading the input in the stepping function (6th argument of play - called periodically) instead of the event handling function (5th argument), as the latter only recognizes keyboard and mouse input. Here is an excerpt of what I&#x27;m doing in the step function, the full details of handleSwitch can be seen here (essentially read input if the buttons are pressed when the stepping function is called, interpret the input and update the scene).
 stepGame :: Float -&gt; C.System&#x27; () stepGame dT &#x3D; do ... ASTM.forkSys (Switch.handleSwitch dT) ... 
 Unfortunately, the player may respond to the first few inputs but then the game crashes. I thought it was a race hazard so I wrapped handleSwitch in forkSys (creates a new thread for switch input) but the issue persists.
 Any ideas on what might be going wrong and how to fix this? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>Hi all, First time experience running Haskell, I wanted to spend some time learning the fundamentals during these holidays break. 
 I installed the Stack installer for windows to a Win10 core i5 (late 2019) laptop with 8 gigs of ram. I then proceeded to create an &#x27;hello world&#x27; project - - stack downloaded GHC 8.10 and created a cabal file (very confused between cabal and stack differences but, I&#x27;ll go with the flow). 
 The machine behaves well with other programing platforms. however, with Haskell/stack it seems very slow... I&#x27;m running stack build and stack test and it takes up to 1 minute in both cases if there is any change to compile (without recompilation, still takes about 30 secs).
 Was just wondering if this slowness is expected? I remember using it on a Ubuntu machine and didn&#x27;t notice it being so slow. Maybe it has to do with the underlying C compiler arch?

                    <span>Anybody know if there&#x27;s plans so that we can go from ADA to a stablecoin from within the main wallets?
 and yes, I did try to research this before asking.
 I really, really and I mean really want this to be a thing and think it would be game changing.
 EDIT: Let me clarify, I know stable coins are coming - what I&#x27;m trying to confirm is if we&#x27;ll be able to swap from ADA to stablecoin like Djed from within the wallets.

 I don&#x27;t mean any disrespect against Cardano!
 [EDIT] Why, if all the statements in the comments are true, has ADA had such a different experience price-wise? And how can we publicise Cardanoâs advantages so external users know itâs power?

                    <span>In one of his many long videos this year, Charles smartly mentioned that decentralization is a &quot;volume knob&quot;, the application of which the EUTXO model of Cardano nicely allows for.
 Let&#x27;s think back to the concurrency FUD related to the different DEX rollouts on Cardano. Ergodex I believe created a solution that relies on a proprietary, centralized &quot;Ergodex back-end&quot;. This solution was critized for being centralized, because the DEX wouldn&#x27;t work if the back-end solution was DDOS&#x27;ed, for example.
 What people fail to see, however, is that this is precisely the &quot;volume knob&quot; Charles mentioned, in action. The EUTXO model allows for everything non-essential to be moved off-chain, with the final important confirmation happening on-chain. I am fine with a back-end solution to help with batching off-chain. In addition, once the number of DEXes grows it becomes highly unlikely that all of them would be DDOS&#x27;ed at once. Not to mention that pure on-chain solutions are likely to exist too and have simply not been discovered yet due to how new EUTXO is for devs. They are likely to come.
 This is the trade-off vs account-based models. I for one welcome with open arms centralized back-end solutions for DEXes as long as the final confirmation of trades happens on-chain, on the best POS network in crypto. This same logic allows for the insane scaling of Hydra, too, I believe. You trim the fat.
 What are your thoughts on EUTXO generally? I personally believe we are simply going through growing pains, and after a few years EUTXO will be the gold standard as account-based models still struggle with fees, certainly with the predictability of them. In short, I have a good feeling.

                    <span>Hi. Newbie question!
 I have the Yori PC Version installed. If I download the app for my phone and restore using the seed I am hoping it will not have a negative effect on the wallet I already have set up. It would be nice to have a mobile version as well if possible. Is this possible?

 Let&#x27;s go...
 Newly covered today:
  
The end of year Cardano 360 will be going down on 12.30.21! https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1473707429875654666
 A two-day countdown is underway for ADAX Pro. Is it a testnet launch? Mainnet? Reports are that itâs a testnet. No one seems to know much. But it looks like we are getting some kind of holiday surprise. Cardano DeFi is heating up! Soon weâll be at full boil! https://twitter.com/adax_pro/status/1473356712232951815
 Very positive coverage from Forbes including a Cardano tracking page! https://twitter.com/ForbesCrypto/status/1473747419200376840

                    <span>How are everyone&#x27;s experiences using Sundae testnet? is it as good as it&#x27;s claimed by some influencers? Even Charles himself said that it might be better than Uniswap mainnet, which is kinda doubting. I have no experience using Uniswap at all, and my experience using Sundae is great, kinda bug here and there but I definitely love the UI. Please share your experiences.

                    <span>Imagine you could trustably wrap your B on Cardano. It gets locked in the verifiable smart contract, and you can always get it back without anybody possibly interfering. And now you can use it on Cardano network in DeFi, fast cheap transactions, mixed transactions, babel transactions, everything. You won&#x27;t even want to go back. As the originals spill into aneta contract, transactions also go down on original. The fees will stay low, blocks not full, halvenings happening. What will the miners do? Could the original netword just... stop. While the tokens continue to live on Cardano? It might even keep its value, but no more wasted energy?

                    <span>It&#x27;s the end of the year and it&#x27;s all about doing a balance: we want (and we need) to measure whether we had a good year or not.
 â
 Luckily, in ALDEA, we have no doubt about this because during 2021:
 â
 - We created aldeawiki.org, the Cardano encyclopedia: with the goal of explaining difficult concepts with short and easy-to-read articles. It&#x27;s managed by a group of 18+ collaborators from our community and it is the first Wiki on our ecosystem. We have plans to onboard more languages, not only Spanish.
 - We launched the first version of ALDEA NFT Marketplace, and now we would like to give more and better services to our community, with the goal of becoming self-sustainable in the long run. Check out this Fund7 proposal to improve the platform.
 - We raised +8200 ada selling NFTs and we will now use that to fund community proposals, thanks to our &quot;Iteration 0&quot;.
 - We count with 24 SPOs of the region (9 different countries) taking part in this process.
 - We truly built a community from scratch in less than 1 year.
 â
 All this would have been impossible without YOUR PARTICIPATION: whether if it was joining a FogÃ³n at 1 AM in the morning, retweeting , commenting on Discord or buying an NFT.
 THANK YOU!!!
 â
 Finally, our plans for 2022 are:
 - Continue growing our community (check out our Fund7 proposal)
 - Continue creating services and trying to generate more and more opportunities for the region
 - And, of course, keep taking Cardano to the next level
 â
 â
 Thanks to everyone. From my heart.
 It&#x27;s great to be part of this community: it&#x27;s great to be part of ALDEA.

                    <span>Hi buddies, what&#x27;s up?
 Firstly, sorry if i have gramaticals errors.
 I just finish a bootcamp of web development (mainly focused in Java), to into in context.
 Now
 I saw some post and articles talking about the great benefits of blockchain development, with positions from 6k to 12k.
 Looking for more info, too i saw a lot of peolple treating the blockchain development as trash and saying that is overrated for the real world.
 AS a newbie in this circle, i would like hear more opinions from your.
 Thanks to everyone, regards from Argentina and Feliz Navidad.

                    <span>Hello,
 I am new to the Cardano dev world and I am trying to draw a comparison between the ERC20 standard and the ADA Native Tokens.
 From what I&#x27;ve been reading so far, I understand that token transfers are natively supported by the ledger without the need of interaction with a smart contract directly. From a programmer perspective, I have to say this is really elegant, hands down to the ADA team for their approach. 
 Is it possible to simulate the so-called ERC20 &quot;tokenomoics&quot; on ADA however? How can one add &quot;on transfer fees&quot; or &quot;automatic redistribution&quot; on every transfer? 
 I hope my questions are not to trivial and really appreciate that you took the time just to read this. All the best!

                    <span>Hello. Over the last couple of weeks I asked 2 questions on this sub and both the times I was asked which book I was reading and also that it may be outdated. 
 Q1
 Q2
 http://learnyouahaskell.com/ is a resource listed in the sidebar of this sub. Is this book really outdated? If so what other similar book would you recommend? I come from a mobile development background (Swift) and for whatever reason, the format of this book makes it very approachable for me.

                    <span>from yesterday&#x27;s thread
 was anxious all day, asked my OGBYN sister to take a look at pregnancy tests, which she thought were false positives. Then I got a new, electronic test from my ex, which confirms that yes, she is pregnant. I was in the grocery store with my mom getting stuff for Christmas, and had to ask to leave early bc I was basically having a panic attack. I told my parents, who reacted surprisingly well. Mom is sort of pissed and conspiratorial, talking about how my career is over and the pregnancy is fake and I am going to die in poverty or whatever, but my dad is actually pretty happy about a new grandchild. I was pretty anxious and felt sick all day, didn&#x27;t eat anything and wanted to throw up
 but now that I talked to my dad for a few hours, and also called my ex and heard her on the line, some part of me is actually kind of happy. I would&#x27;ve wished to have gotten married beforehand, and I guess it would be nice to date, be stable, then get married, but tbh I&#x27;m so indecisive that I think I always would have had hangups and anxiety about anyone, so maybe it&#x27;s a good thing that fate has forced the matter.
 assuming everything stays on track, I&#x27;m thinking I will marry her. she&#x27;s kinda sorta crazy but mostly in a good way and the other stuff seems insignificant now. I figure that most people throughout human history get married in circumstances kind of like these, and that, even if they have problems going in, things will tend to work out. Or they don&#x27;t work out, but life is still livable. Overall I really love this girl and am starting to see the happy side of things. Wish me luck and say a prayer for us

                    <span>Greetings! I am not really sure where to start with this. but essentially me and a group of friends have purchased a theatre and most of the surrounding buildings in a town on the west coast USA. I can&#x27;t really give away the whole plan yet, but we have pretty big things in the works to create a very large music/culture/event venue. We want to be one of the first venues to be built on the cardano blockchain, and I figured it couldnt hurt to reach out to the community! We are looking for ideas to incorporate cardano into our project, as well as possibly help with the publicity that we hope to capitalize on by using cryptocurrency in the new digital age! 
 Thank you, cheers!

                    <span>As an early adopter in Cardano, I was blessed to have decent bags as dapps get ready to launch. I&#x27;m no whale, more like jellyfish, but I still feel blessed.
 So this Christmas in recognition of dapps launching next year, I&#x27;ve decided to send all my personal friends who don&#x27;t own Cardano or Crypto a ledger nano and 50 free ADA. Not promising them some get rich scheme, but giving free access to play and learn in the easiest project for introduction to the space.
 This is something I considered before, but it was always too complicated. Trying to explain to someone who doesn&#x27;t feel they have the time what are gas fee&#x27;s, polygon vs Ethereum networks, why so many different wallets, etc, etc was wayyy too complicated. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, in true ape fashion, I jumped in and blew money playing around and made some gains in areas too. However, I could not expect that from friends or family. Cardano&#x27;s native asset management through a single wallet address, security of the hard fork combinator with upgrades, and the coming dapp wave has finally pushed me to do this on a project in the blockchain space. Having them imagine that instead of a jpeg of nothingness, imagine that&#x27;s just one of many health records or property housing deeds, credit worthiness or any other data we currently give to tens to hundreds of companies to store and expose to hacks.
 Anyways, thought it was a good idea for adoption, and wanted to share in case any other fortunate community members wanted to share their ideas and help push adoption through free, understandable introductions.
 Have a wonderful holiday season community, here&#x27;s to 2022 ð»ð»ð¥

                    <span>Just stumbled upon this article and I thought I&#x27;d give you a quick overview of why I&#x27;m really pumped for what&#x27;s arriving next month.
 â
 DeFi Ecosystem on Cardano
 DeFi requires you to have --&gt; A web wallet (NAMI, YOROI, etc) which will let you:
  
Make swaps / Provide liquidity on DEXes (SundaeSwap)
 Use leveraged instruments and synthetic assets (Indigoprotocol)
 Optimize your yield farming (Geniusyield)
 Trade NFTs (Cnft)
  
Turns out we have all that... It&#x27;s all ready to be unleashed, once the PAB is released by Jan 2022.
 I personally made good ROI during the DeFi season in 2020 by aping in DEXes. Seems to have a very good R / R overall. I&#x27;m targetting SundaeSwap + Cardashift incubated DEX. NFA
 The days of Cardano being poked for having little to show for, is now undeniably coming to an end. I know where my money will be next year anon. Do you ?

                    <span>In one of his videos on his YouTube channel, Charles Hoskinson once talked about a conversation he had with one of the creators of the internet. CH was basically reflecting upon the regrets the man expressed over designed decisions that had been made that were horrible and that have led to creating an internet with many vulnerabilities... and how he wanted things to be different for Cardano. 
 CH then reiterated his commitment to ensuring that Cardano become a massive financial system that had to be built rightly from the start, so that when it is all said and done, he would feel differently about Cardano than what that man did about the internet. (The internet is to big now to make major changes to some of the past design decisions). CH doesnât approve of the âmove fast, break thingsâ culture of the software culture. Ethereum, for example, is still figuring out how to deal with some of their past poor design decisions, just like that internet founder.
 Which brings me to this interview Iâve been watching where the Charli3 team through their communication with IOHK had their code audited by a very reputable company. This allowed Charli3 to find issues early in their codebase. And even though none of the issues were devastating, they were important enough to merit revisions. CH is also intent on the creation of certification programs to give Dapps the option to vet their code to ensure a minimum standard of quality and safety. 
 This may seem inconsequential now as Cardanoâs ecosystem is still in the early days of its growth, but this is going to bring massive changes to the Dapp ecosystem in crypto in the long-run. And the quality of the Dapps on Cardano at launch will be high and likelihood of security flaws will be reduced significantly. This is going to be a huge game changer for the crypto space, and will be a major selling point for adoption and trust from users and businesses alike.

As you might have guessed I am a complete beginner when it comes to technical part of staking/delegation and node setup. Can anybody help me with the setup process and potential hardware/software cost for initial setup of cardano node? Thanks in advance. Cheers!

                    <span>I have a little bit of understanding about the ERC20 Converter... I know it locks up the tokens on Etherium and creates a Cardano equivalent that can be used or traded. But what happens if someone wants to cash out back to fiat. Do they need to convert back to the Etherium network and then sell? What happens to the locked value on the Etherium network? Of course if they want to cash out they can convert the &quot;Etherium&quot; token to Ada and cash out, but my question still stands as above.

                    <span>You may think the title is misleading, it&#x27;s not. 
 What I mean by relatives is that these two cryptocurrencies are derived from the same parent document. This document is cited at the bottom of Bitcoin&#x27;s Whitepaper and is linked here: http://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt. Anyone is free to read the document (it&#x27;s fairly short) but I will leave my own observations below.
 The document is broken in two demonstrations for methods to create &quot;crypto-anarchy&quot; or a government free currency. 
 The first protocol describes Bitcoin with some prehistoric modifications: 
  
Creation of money via solving a previously unsolved computational problem.
 Transfer of money via broadcasting the transaction to everyone on the blockchain.
  
There is more general cryptocurrency ideas I&#x27;m choosing to skip over.
 This all makes sense considering the document is cited in Bitcoin&#x27;s wallpaper. But, then the author offers another protocol. 
  
Using &quot;servers&quot; linked by a Usenet-style broadcast channel instead of peer-to-peer. 
 I believe these resemble ADA&#x27;s Staking Pools
 
 The servers agree on the amount of money (ADA) to be created during each period (Epoch).
  
This post is nothing more than an observation I had while I was reading this document. Or maybe it was an applause to this author (who is unnamed) for his imagination and accuracy in 1998. With all this said, I stand with my statement that Cardano and Bitcoin are, in fact, relatives.

                    <span>Hi,i have to tell you that i consider myself a beginner.I can&#x27;t dedicate much time to learn how to code.I started to learn how to program in python becuase i wanted to make a crypto ml trading bot.After a while i realized that there isn&#x27;t a formula for trading and that i probably never will be able to develop something complex like that.I really love Cardano and i follow it every single day.Since i am a really bad programmer,maybe i will find some motivation to improve my python skills with Cardano.I know that Cardano is going the Haskell and Plutus route but is there something that i can do with my really basic python knowledge?Pls tell me that i can do something Thank you

                    <span>Has anyone ever overused monads and created bugs because of using them in an imperative style? If so, how did you get past that stage of your learning process? How can I try to use Monads more safely? This problem arose especially because of my use of the State monad.
 I feel like I went full circle with my FP understanding: Noob -&gt; Understands some -&gt; Understands Monads and has mind blown -&gt; Uses them -&gt; Blows up in face -&gt; is now scared -&gt; Noob

                    <span>hey everyone, Iâm new here so idk if this has already been addressed in earlier posts but Iâm a comp sci minor and Iâm taking Haskell in the spring. Iâve taken python which I found decent and enjoyable but Iâve heard mixed reviews about Haskell. Iâm taking another programming class but I know myself and once it starts getting harder I might fall behind since I heard Haskell is extremely hard to learn. 
 I have about a month before classes resume and would love to do something productive with my time. So Iâm wondering if anyone knows any good platforms or sites that do a really good job at teaching Haskell.
 Thanks in advance.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I am going through Typeclassopedia, and currently got stuck at the first set of exercises in the Monad section, namely the 3rd one:
  
Implement Functor and Monad instances for Free f, defined as data Free f a &#x3D; Var a | Node (f (Free f a)) You may assume that f has a Functor instance. This is known as the free monad built from the functor f.
  
I got the Functor instance for Free f, but with my Monad instance I am getting this error when trying to load it into ghci:
 â¢ Could not deduce (Applicative (Free f)) arising from the superclasses of an instance declaration from the context: Functor f bound by the instance declaration at Freemonad.hs:22:10-36 â¢ In the instance declaration for âMonad (Free f)â 
 My guess is that that&#x27;s due to this part in the monad definition in Control.Monad
  
class Applicative m &#x3D;&gt; Monad m where
  
which it seems like it wasn&#x27;t always there.
 So:
  
Is there some other way around it, or do I have to provide instance of Applicative for Free f first? Bonus question: should Typeclassopedia be updated to include this information?
 I can&#x27;t figure out how to implement Applicative for Free f, any hints?
  
In case it matters, here is my Monad instance, that I have convinced myself on paper that it should work
 instance Functor f &#x3D;&gt; Monad (Free f) where return &#x3D; Var (Var x) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; g &#x3D; g x (Node x) &gt;&gt;&#x3D; g &#x3D; Node $ (fmap.(flip (&gt;&gt;&#x3D;))) g x 
 but I have also tried implementation from this stackoverflow answer and got same error in ghci.

                    <span>I wrote a program in Emacs Lisp that turns a decimal number into a base-256 number. The numbers involved are very large, so here&#x27;s the logic of it, where base256 is an array of unicode characters, myNum is a number in the septenseptuagintacentillions, and output is an output variable initially set to nil:
  (while (&gt;&#x3D; myNum 1) (setq output (concat output (aref base256 (mod myNum 256)))) (setq myNum (truncate (/ myNum 256)))) 
 I want to rewrite it in Haskell, but I&#x27;m having some trouble. Obviously, I can&#x27;t use the same logic in Haskell, so here is what I have so far: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; -- Builds an array of integers by taking the modulus of each iteration of dividing a number by 256 buildNum num &#x3D; [mod x 256 | x &lt;- (iterate trunkDiv num)] where trunkDiv l &#x3D; truncate $ div l 256
 -- Create an array by accessing the item in my array of symbols that corresponds to a number in an array of integers mapNum nums syms &#x3D; [syms !! y | y &lt;- nums]
 main :: IO () main &#x3D; do putStrLn $ mapNum (buildNum myNum) base256 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Now, as far as I can tell, what I need is to stop iterating when the truncated product of my number and 256 reaches 1, but I don&#x27;t know where to even begin looking for that information.
 Could anybody give me some pointers on getting this to work?

                    <span>Renovate is used widely to help manage dependencies. Since this week was a short week for us at Caribou, two of us spent some time starting the work to add Haskell support https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/pull/13224. It needs help.
 If anyone is inclined to pick up where we left off, or start a brand new branch using some or all of what we did, please do! Please communicate your intent on the PR itself so if there are others who want to also work on it, you don&#x27;t have to duplicate their work.
 There&#x27;s another new tool in this same space, Stack Lint Extra Deps. The maintainer was kind enough to get on a phone call with us on Monday to discuss pros and cons of working on SLED vs Renovate, and the consensus is we&#x27;d all like to see Renovate support Haskell first. But Renovate is written in TypeScript and SLED is written in Haskell so if you&#x27;d like to help but don&#x27;t like/know TypeScript, SLED is a good candidate to hack on :D

                    <span>For those who are not aware, there are now 60k transactions on mainnet involving the MuesliSwap smart contract and over 100k ADA locked into it. The MuesliSwap contract is by far the most used smart contract on Cardano. DeFi is finally here! But please be careful when interacting with MuesliSwap since it&#x27;s a young project which has not yet been audited. Only risk the money you are willing to lose.

 Is there a good method for storing photos and/or text documents in the cardano chain?
 If not, other chains?
 I just like the idea of an absolutely immutable storage method for baby pictures, etc. Not necessarily concerned about keeping it Ft. Knox secure.

                    <span>Hi everyone,
 It&#x27;s been a long Apeirogon week. Lots of successes, but also learnings! One of the biggest topics for Artano was, and still is KYC.
 We would love to hear your opinion about our KYC procedure, and KYC in general on Cardano and how we can improve it through this Google Form. 
 Thank you, we really appreciate your input and let us know if you have any specific questions in the comments. This is just the beginning of the KYC conversation on Cardano, and specifically how can we bank the unbanked AND abide to regulatory changes that are coming to the crypto world. 
 Here&#x27;s the form link, thank you very much and stay awesome!

                    <span>I&#x27;m seeing so many fud posts of people complaing about daedalus performance.
 Of course the correct answer is that if they are not a cryptoanarchist willing to sacrifice their computer performance for helping the health of the ecosystem and bickering about it instead, theay should jsut use a light wallet like a normal mainstream person. We will still probably have more than enough full nodes running around the world from people willuing to do that, so we don&#x27;t need everyone to do it.
 So even if recommending Daedalus to everyone might seem like a good idea helping the health of the network, it might be doing more damage than help in the adoption and make people who don&#x27;t realize the difference between light and full nodes hate Cardano. The light wallets exist for a reason. They might think this is the issie only with it because other blockchains are already past the point of recommending full nodes as the first options to everyone. Heck, most people have theirt bitcoin in custody already I think.
 So let&#x27;s stop putting Daedalus as the first recommended wallet, we should still mention it, but warn about it&#x27;s consequences and inform what using it means together with such recommendation. But for some reason, most tutorials for newbies on how to use Cardano only recommend Daedalus with no warnings or explanations. That&#x27;s just hurtful...
 There&#x27;s already enough fud as it is, we don&#x27;t need to shoot ourselves in the foot giving them even more ammo like this.

                    <span>UPDATE: this appears to be a general issue with counting transactions of an address. Not exactly sure which page counts what exactly still but it seems to be general for cardano addresses. It might be the difference of whether an address only counts outcoming vs. incoming and outcoming transactions. But I&#x27;d have to confirm this first. We should also think about what this implies when comparing contract volumes... 
 We have seen a stark rise in Smart Contract usage recently and I was curious how many transactions the most used Smart Contract so far had.
 I found MusliSwap, reporting that they had crossed 50k interactions recently on twitter:https://twitter.com/MuesliSwapTeam/status/1472740442999595014
 This seems reasonable, as only recently they were confirmed to be far ahead with only 30k interactions.
 Now I checked cardanoscan, the address they gave and can confirm that at the time of writing it is already beyond 50k (at 59k)https://cardanoscan.io/address/addr1wy2mjh76em44qurn5x73nzqrxua7ataasftql0u2h6g88lc3gtgpz
 I wanted to cross-check and went to adapools...https://adapools.org/address/addr1wy2mjh76em44qurn5x73nzqrxua7ataasftql0u2h6g88lc3gtgpz
 They have already 74k transactions there. So they certainly crossed 50k and seem to have taken the minimum of both counts, which is very cool to see (a dApp truly coming to live!)
 But what still grinds my gears: How can this huge margin occur? Do the websites count differently? What could make the difference in the way they count?

                    <span>There is so much hype for good projects launching on cardano, so it just makes sense to start a good idea on this platform. On other blockchains the spotlight is often stolen by existing giants, and in ethereum&#x27;s case, L2s, whereas we here are keen to see what devs can come up with (anything that can give us the edge). Would like put some of those staked ada rewards to use.

                    <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m Jeff, a long time member of the community. My days go back to a Cardano meeting with Sebastien at the Microsoft building in Seattle...2018.
 We are excited to announce a new project and are looking for team members to fill specific roles. 
 The project is focused around auctions for CNFT. We have a dynamite domain, web template and promotional talent onboard. There will be an evolution to support stakepools which will be announced at a later date. Very exciting
 We will also have a charity auction with more details to come. Community will vote where per auction. 
 All sales will have a portion dedicated to a lump sum to be awarded by the community chosen beneficiary. Lots of fun.
 The immediate opportunities:
 âï¸ Experience with HTML to edit and do updates to the site.
 âï¸Cardano smart contract dev
 âï¸Telegram, Twitter and other community interaction platform representative/ambassador
 Please message me if you are interested. Some folks have offered up front, but we wanted to share our opportunity to the community here. We will share in work and celebrate the $uccess together.
 Thank you and Happy Holiday! 
 Cheers,
 Jeff

 The materials are available at https://github.com/google/haskell-trainings and any feedback is much appreciated.

 I thought about using DataKinds and KindSignatures to set if the Item can be used in trades and i thought about putting the class of a mage like if he is a Mage as a Phantom type. I dunno if it&#x27;s a dumb but i want to learn creative ways to enforce some properties.
 What are the cool mechanics that u can enforce using types in Haskell? :)

                    <span>Hello, i just started to be a good citizen and write some regression tests for my code.
 Considering i have some error-type and a function that might result in an error:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;haskell newtype Username &#x3D; Username{unUsername::Text} data UsernameError &#x3D; ErrorNameLength | ErrorNameIllegalCharacter
 -- smart constructor for username newUsername :: Text -&gt; Either LoginError Username newUsername name &#x3D; ... -- inspects argument and might return Left &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 in my HUnit test, how would I assert that e.g. newUsername with &quot;&quot; results in ErrorNameLength?
 My thoughts is to do it with pattern matching in do notation, relying on the MonadFail instance of IO. While this works, i see that HUnits assertion-functions allow to provide a descriptive error message in case of failure.
 Therefore I am questioning wether this would be the correct way.

                    <span>In my continued attempt to get mstksg&#x27;s AOC template working, I temporarily gave up on my MacOS attempt (thanks again /u/simonmic for the help so far!) and switched to my Linux box. After a long failure trying to use apt-get install haskell-platform and getting unfixable (by me) dependency errors, I switched to using ghcup (why do we even have haskell-platform if it&#x27;s not going to work?), and things seem to be compiling and running.
 But now I have some (hopefully basic) questions. - The &quot;Interactive&quot; section of the documentation says I should be able to import an AOC.Run.Interactive package. I do not see how to do this. Where / how do I run ghci to import this? I can see the Haskell file in src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs, but import AOC.Run.Interactive fails with ghci run in either the top level or down in src. If I :l src/AOC/Run/Interactive.hs I get Illegal lambda-case (use LambdaCase), but I didn&#x27;t think that was the right thing in the first place. I assume I&#x27;m missing something simple and obvious here? - The &quot;Executable&quot; section of the documentation says I should be able to get a plain old runnable executable aoc-dev. How do I get this? Right now I&#x27;m using cabal run aoc-dev run 1 a for instance. (If I do build an executable, do I need to rebuild it when I change a day&#x27;s solution?)
 As always any help is most appreciated.

                    <span>A couple of weeks ago Nix 2.4 was
released. This
was the first release in more than two years. More than 195
individuals contributed to this release. Since Tweag is the biggest
contributor to the Nix project, Iâd like to highlight some of the
features that Tweag has worked on.

Flakes
Flakes are a new format to package Nix-based projects in a more
discoverable, composable, consistent and reproducible way. A flake is
just a repository or tarball containing a file named flake.nix that
specifies dependencies on other flakes and returns any Nix assets such
as packages, Nixpkgs overlays, NixOS modules or CI tests.
You can read more about flakes in the following blog posts:

                    <span>Twice a year â in May and November, nixpkgs maintainers and
contributors get together to fix as many build failures as possible
for the new release. The event is, as per tradition, called Zero Hydra
Failures, or ZHF for short.
This year, me and fellow hacker cab404
had organized a hackathon to help the cause and spread the Nix love
around. The basic premise was, quoting cab404:
Goâgoâgo!
We wanted to fix as many builds as possible, right before the
branchoff. Fixing the broken builds would allow NixOS 21.11 to have a more complete package
set.
The main point of this post is to share the experience with people
looking to organize similar events.

Preparation
Due to the current lockdown in Moscow, we
werenât able to decide whether the hackathon would happen at all until
about a week before tâ¦</span>

                    <span>Type-checking plugins interface directly with GHCâs constraint solver. This means we need to have
a certain level of familiarity with how GHC generates, manipulates and solves constraints.
In this post, we will attempt to demystify this constraint solving process, as well as review
a few aspects of type-family reduction, to facilitate the development of type-checking plugins.
This post will serve as a reference, when we start writing our own type-checking plugins in Part III.
Donât worry: you donât need to know everything before you start writing your own plugins!
Itâs only when debugging a type-checking plugin that the rubber hits the road:
a few skills become rather important, such as the ability to understand the different types of constraints,
to read Core (and, in particular, coercionâ¦</span>

                    <span>Although the feature is still marked as experimental, the release of Nix 2.4 marks the entry of content-addressed derivations in a released Nix version.
This is something to celebrate, but also an occasion to look back and see what this addition means, implementation wise.
This new feature required indeed some deep changes both in the high-level algorithm describing the build loop (and also as a consequence in its low-level details) as well as in the âplumbingâ code around it.
Note: Because it touches the implementation, this post will be more technical than the others, and will also assume that youâre somewhat familiar with what content-addressed derivations means, and how it works. If you havenât done it already, I invite you to read the previous blog articles on the topic (1, 2 and 3), â¦</span>
