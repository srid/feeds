              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Hi all,
 I&#39;m developing a reflex application (not using obelisk; I only need a frontend and it seems like obelisk does not have a straight forward way of doing frontend only), and previously, I was able to use the web inspector in the webkitgtk window that my app produced. This was pretty helpful to track down CSS errors. Unfortunately, it stopped working about 6 months back, and now when you try to inspect an element, the area where the inspector should be is just some code with a copyright notice at t…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Apologies if this has been answered elsewhere, but a Google search yielded nothing.
 I just found about the 1999 Lightweight Extensible Records for Haskell paper my Mark P Jones and Simon Peyton Jones.
 To the oldtimers who were around at that time, I&#39;m curious, what happened? Why wasn&#39;t it implemented in GHC? Apparently, it&#39;s a development of a previous implementation in Hugs, so it wasn&#39;t even purely academical at that point.
